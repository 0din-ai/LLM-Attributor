### Instruction:
What does IPO mean in stock market?

### Response:
 [ATTR TEXT] IPO stands for Initial Public Offering. It is the first sale of stocks by a company to the public. When a company decides to go public, it issues an IPO to raise capital and list its shares on a stock exchange. This allows the company to access a larger pool of investors and raise funds for expansion, debt repayment, or other financial needs. The IPO process typically involves hiring underwriters, preparing a prospectus, and filing with regulatory authorities. Once the IPO is completed, the company's shares are listed on a stock exchange and can be bought and sold by the public. [ATTR TOKEN POS] 4,5,6,7,8,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23",ASeydQWjkI
