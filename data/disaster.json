        "title": "Social media videos push baseless conspiracy theory that blue items were spared from Maui wildfires | AP News",
        "text": "A general view shows the aftermath of a devastating wildfire in Lahaina, Hawaii, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2023. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\nCLAIM: Only blue items survived the Maui wildfires and lasers do not impact that color, suggesting the island was actually hit by a directed energy weapon \u201cattack.\u201d\nAP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: False. The wildfires didn\u2019t spare only blue things, with photos and videos clearly showing buildings and objects of many colors both survived and perished. And while lasers can affect various materials differently, one powerful enough to do such damage would still burn items of any hue, according to an expert. More importantly, there is ample evidence that Maui was ravaged by fires, while the notion that a weapon or laser was involved has been repeatedly debunked.\nTHE FACTS: False claims that a directed energy weapon was the real cause of the devastation on Maui have been circulating online since the fires in early August, despite all evidence to the contrary.\nThe latest iteration of the baseless conspiracy theory uses cherry-picked images of the aftermath to falsely suggest that only blue items \u201csurvived\u201d the blaze \u2014 and that this is somehow proof that the Hawaiian island was hit by a laser that either sparked the fire or did all the damage itself.\nSocial media posts sharing the post typically include a video from a TikTok account that often shares clips of everyday items being burned by a handheld industrial laser in a workshop. The clip shows the laser burning yellow, red and green fabric, while a blue swatch is unscathed, with text saying it can be programmed for \u201cdifferent wavelengths.\u201d\nThey contrast this footage with imagery from Lahaina, the historic Maui town that was largely leveled by the wildfire, noting a blue car and some blue beach umbrellas around Front Street, along the waterfront, were not destroyed in the inferno.\nSome posts noted that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has a long-running program called \u201cOperation Blue Roof.\u201d\nOne post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, also points to several blue t-shirts found under some rubble that were relatively unscathed. \u201cUnbelievable. Everything that\u2019s BLUE survived the Maui DEW attack, including T-SHIRTS,\u201d reads the post, which had more with more than 18,000 likes as of Wednesday.\nDEW stands for directed energy weapons \u2014 which use technology like high-energy lasers instead of projectiles like bullets. But these videos are not evidence that they have anything to do with the wildfires.\nTo start with, they show just a handful of blue items in the fire\u2019s aftermath, but other footage and photos show these were hardly the only things left standing.\nThe blue car and umbrellas can both be seen in drone footage of the devastation \u2014 but the same video also shows red and green dumpsters and buildings painted various other colors that survived. Aerial footage taken by the Associated Press shows similar scenes.\nBefore-and-after satellite images also show that a number of buildings that were painted blue were still destroyed.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to see some items and structures still standing after wildfires because the fires often spread through flying embers that don\u2019t hit everything, experts previously told the AP. Images of the fire\u2019s aftermath do not show anything abnormal, they said.\nFEMA\u2019s Operation Blue Roof, meanwhile, is a long-running initiative to provide plastic sheeting to cover homes damaged by storms to help reduce further damage to the property. \u201cBlue\u201d refers to the color of the sheeting \u2014 not the homes themselves.\nRegardless, there is no evidence to suggest that Maui was hit by anything other than wildfires, which were witnessed by survivors and documented extensively in videos and images. The video of a laser sparing some blue fabric is not evidence to the contrary, according to Iain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado.\nWhile it is possible for high energy lasers to interact in different ways with objects made of different materials or even colors, a beam with enough power to start a large fire would just burn through material of any color, he explained in an email to the AP.\n\u201cEven more relevant, though, is that these images show areas through which a large fire has raged and the damage that has been caused no longer has anything to do with whatever caused the fire in the first place,\u201d Boyd added in an email. \u201cIf these images are genuine, they are saying that blue objects are not susceptible to fire, which we all know is not true.\u201d\nMaui County has filed a lawsuit against Hawaiian Electric Company over the fires, saying it failed to shut off power despite exceptionally high winds and dry conditions. The company on Sunday acknowledged that its power line started the first wildfire, but said its power lines in West Maui had been de-energized for hours before a more serious second blaze, which tore through downtown Lahaina, killing at least 115 and destroying 2,000 structures.\nThis is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

        "title": "Video claiming to show a directed-energy weapon is actually an edited clip of an explosion in Russia | AP News",
        "text": "CLAIM: A video of a laser beam starting an explosion at a gas station in Russia is an example of a directed-energy weapon in action.\nAP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: False. A 9-year-old video was altered to add the laser beam. An unedited version of the same footage can be seen in news reports from 2014 about an explosion at a gas station in Makhachkala, a southwestern Russian city on the Caspian Sea. Lasers powerful enough to start such a fire could not be seen by the naked eye, as they use infrared technology, an aerospace engineering expert told The Associated Press.\nTHE FACTS: In the aftermath of the deadly Maui wildfires, social media users have shared altered and miscaptioned images, falsely claiming they prove a baseless conspiracy theory that the fires were started by a directed-energy weapon. As these posts circulated, a video shared on Instagram claimed to show such a weapon being used.\nThe video shows what appears to be a red laser beam shooting down from the sky and starting a fire in front of a gas station, which explodes seconds later. Captions on the video read, \u201cLASER BEAM WEAPON\u201d and \u201cRED LASER BEAM ATTACK?\u201d\nOne post that shared the video wrote: \u201cThis is how it looks to see DEWs in action.\u201d\n\u201cDEW\u201d stands for directed-energy weapon. This technology uses \u201cconcentrated electromagnetic energy,\u201d according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. That includes \u201chigh energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics.\u201d\nBut the laser beam in the video being shared online was edited into the footage. It does not appear in an unedited version posted on YouTube in August 2014 by Russian media outlet RIA Dagestan. The fire and resulting explosion, however, do materialize.\nThe outlet reported that the incident occurred on Aug. 8, 2014, in Makhachkala, a southwestern Russian city that sits beside the Caspian Sea in the country\u2019s Republic of Dagestan.\nThe AP independently confirmed that the incident took place in Makhachkala by using Google Maps to identify two landmarks that appeared in the video posted by RIA Dagestana \u2014 a large billboard on the side of a building and another building with a distinctive blue roof. As of August 2019, the latest available images on Google Maps show that another gas station replaced the one that exploded.\nIain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told the AP that he does not believe the edited video shows \u201cany kind of laser\u201d and that the impact of a directed-energy weapon wouldn\u2019t actually appear as a visible laser beam.\n\u201cModern lasers with power that is high enough to start any kind of fire operate in the infrared and so cannot be seen by the naked eye,\u201d he said.\nThe Maui wildfires are the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century, responsible for a death toll of at least 96. Officials have not yet determined the cause of the fires, which were fueled by dry weather and the winds of a nearby hurricane.___Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo in New York contributed to this report.___This is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

        "title": "2023 Hawaii wildfires",
        "text": "In early August 2023, a series of wildfires broke out in the U.S. state of Hawaii, predominantly on the island of Maui. The wind-driven fires prompted evacuations, caused widespread damage, killing at least 100 people and leaving four persons missing in the town of Lahaina on Maui's northwest coast. The proliferation of the wildfires was attributed to dry, gusty conditions created by a strong high-pressure area north of Hawaii and Hurricane Dora to the south.\nAn emergency declaration was signed on August 8, authorizing several actions, including activation of the Hawaii National Guard, appropriate actions by the director of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and the Administrator of Emergency Management, and the expenditure of state general revenue funds for relief of conditions created by the fires. By August 9, the state government of Hawaii issued a state of emergency for the entirety of the state. On August 10, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a federal major disaster declaration.\nFor the Lahaina fire alone, the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimated that over 2,200 buildings had been destroyed, overwhelmingly residential and including many historic landmarks in Lahaina. The damage caused by the fire has been estimated at nearly $6billion. In September 2023, the United States Department of Commerce published the official damage total of the wildfires as $5.5 billion (2023 USD).\nThe typical area burned by wildfires in Hawaii has increased in recent decades, almost quadrupling. Experts have blamed the increase on the spread of nonnative vegetation and hotter, drier weather due to climate change.\nDuring the 2010s and early 2020s, Clay Trauernicht, a botanist and fire scientist at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, and several other experts warned that the decline of agriculture in Hawaii meant that large areas of formerly productive land had been left unmanaged; nonnative invasive species like guinea grass were spreading rapidly and increasing the risk of large wildfires. The state government failed to provide incentives or impose mandates to keep land clear of grass.  The state government also did not require all structure owners to maintain defensible space, a standard rule in fire-prone states like California. The shrinking of the agricultural workforce reduced overall firefighting capacity; those workers had traditionally suppressed fires on the land they cared for, and were so effective that sometimes the counties called them for help. In 2022, Trauernicht suggested that Hawaii follow  Europe's example by subsidizing agriculture as a public good as a form of fire risk reduction.  In 2023, UH Manoa biogeography professor Camilo Mora estimated the cost of land restoration to mitigate wildfire risk at about $1 billion.  Despite these calls to action, the Hawaii State Legislature had been unable to make much progress; a 2022 bill to spend just $1.5 million on additional fire risk reduction measures died in a legislative committee.\nAround the time the fires occurred, twenty percent of the county of Maui was experiencing moderate drought (level 1 of 4), and sixteen percent of the county was under severe drought conditions (level 2 of 4). A decrease in rainfall consistent with the predicted impacts of climate change had also been recorded in the Hawaiian Islands, according to the U.S. National Climate Assessment. In the decades leading up to the fire, overdevelopment practices led to further water management challenges that reduced the availability of water for firefighting and exacerbated drought conditions.\nIn June 2014, the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, a nonprofit organization, prepared a Western Maui Community Wildfire Protection Plan which warned that most of the Lahaina area was at extremely high risk for burning.\nIn Maui County's 2020 Hazard Mitigation Plan, the county identified Lahaina, the most heavily impacted community in the August fires, as lying within a high risk zone for wildfire.\nIn its monthly seasonal outlook on August 1, 2023, the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) forecast \"above normal\" potential for significant wildland fires for Hawaii in August, concentrated on the islands' leeward sides. In addition to noting plentiful vegetation growth from the previous wet season and the expanding drought, the NIFC mentioned that \"tropical cyclones can also bring windy and dry conditions depending on how they approach the island chain and can exacerbate fire growth potential\".\nThe vulnerability of the islands to deadly wildfires was gravely underestimated in long term assessments. A year prior, the State of Hawaii Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan Report had detailed wildfire risks as one of the lowest threats for the state. A 2021 Maui County assessment acknowledged the spike of wildfires in the state, but described funds as \"inadequate\" and heavily criticized the county fire department's strategic plan, claiming it said \"nothing about what can and should be done to prevent fires.\"\nIn early August 2023, a high-pressure system remained north of the Hawaiian Islands. This formed strong surface pressure north of the islands, and also sustained stabilization across the region, creating warm and sunny conditions. Concurrently, Hurricane Dora began to intensify to Category 4 strength, which helped to create a large pressure difference between the high-pressure area and the low-pressure cyclone. This pressure difference aided in already significant trade winds moving southwest, and formed strong gradient winds over the islands. (A similar phenomenon occurred during the October 2017 Portugal wildfires during the passage of Hurricane Ophelia.) The exact significance of Hurricane Dora and how it impacted the fires themselves remains somewhat unclear. Meteorologists noted that the storm's center remained more than 700 miles (1,100km) from the islands and that it remained relatively small in size; however it also remained \"remarkably potent for a long time\", logging more hours as a Category 4 hurricane than any other storm in the Pacific for over 50 years. Philippe Papin, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, argued that Hurricane Dora played only a minor role in \"enhancing low-level flow over Maui at fire initiation time.\"\nBy August 6, the National Weather Service identified a region of very dry air arriving from the East Pacific, greatly inhibiting the potential for rainfall. A prominent descending capping inversion forced even more stabilization of the atmosphere, which led to enhanced wind gusts and very dry conditions between August 7 and 8. As the day progressed, deep layer ridging combined with the existing pressure gradient created very strong wind gusts and caused humidity levels to be well below normal. The aforementioned cap was expected to only strengthen acceleration of wind due to terrain features near the islands.\nDuring the first few days of August, a multitude of minor brush fires affected the Hawaiian Islands. Multiple brush fires burned on the island of O\u02bbahu, stretching fire department resources, but were quickly contained by August 4. The island's south and west sides remained abnormally dry or in drought because of the fire, as well as weather conditions.\nAt 5:00a.m. HST (UTC 15:00) on August 7, the National Weather Service's office in Honolulu issued a red flag warning for the leeward portions of all the islands until the morning of August 9, highlighting that \"very dry fuels combined with strong and gusty easterly winds and low humidities will produce critical fire weather conditions through Tuesday night\". East winds of 30\u201345 miles per hour (48\u201372km/h) with gusts over 60 miles per hour (97km/h) were forecast. In Maui County, officials reported gusts up to 80 miles per hour (130km/h) in the Upcountry Maui area.\nOn August 4, 2023, at 11:01a.m. HST (UTC 21:01), the first of many small fires ignited on Maui. A 30-acre brush fire was reported adjacent to the Kahului Airport in a field. By 9:29p.m. HST (UTC 07:29), the fire was reported 90% contained, but many flights out of the airport were delayed to August 11.\nOn August 8, 2023, intense winds knocked down numerous utility poles. By 4:55p.m. HST (UTC 02:55), \"about 30 downed poles\" had been reported on Maui, resulting in \"at least 15 separate outages impacting more than 12,400 customers\". By that time, there had been no power in some parts of West Maui since 4:50a.m. HST (UTC 14:50). Downed power lines are being investigated as a factor in igniting the fires, having been captured on video.\nThe first significant fire of the event was reported at 12:22a.m. HST (UTC 10:30) on August 8 near Olinda Road in the community of Kula, in Upcountry Maui. Evacuations of nearby residents were announced beginning at 3:43a.m. (UTC 13:43). As of August 9, the fire had burned approximately 1,000 acres (400ha). Approximately 544 structures were exposed, 96% of which were residential, and 16 burned. Concurrent electrical grid sensor data and security camera footage reported by The Washington Post indicate that a downed power line, hit by a tree, may have caused this fire.\nThe most significant fire of the complex of events began from a brush fire ignited in West Maui near the town of Lahaina on the morning of August 8. During the early morning hours of August 8, significant straight-line winds began to impact the town of Lahaina. Peak wind gusts that exceeded 80 miles per hour (130km/h) began to cause minor damage to homes and buildings in Lahaina, and subsequently, a power pole was snapped along Lahainaluna Road, across the street from the Lahaina Intermediate School near the northeast side of town.\nA three-acre (1.2ha) brush fire was reported at 6:37a.m. HST (UTC 16:37) as the downed power line sparked flames to dry grass near the road. Evacuations were ordered minutes later in the areas around Lahaina Intermediate School. Maui County Fire Department immediately responded, and by 9:00a.m HST (UTC 19:00), the fire was announced fully contained. Wind gusts continued to batter the town however, and by 3:30p.m. HST (UTC 01:30), the fire had flared up again, and forced the closure of Lahaina Bypass (Route 3000), with more evacuations nearby following. Residents on the west side of town received instructions to shelter in place.\nThe wildfire rapidly grew in both size and intensity. Wind gusts pushed the flames through the northeastern region of the community, where dense neighborhoods were. Hundreds of homes burned in a matter of minutes, and residents identifying the danger attempted to flee in vehicles while surrounded by flames. As time progressed, the fire moved southwest and downslope towards the Pacific coast and Kahoma neighborhood. Firefighters were repeatedly stymied in their attempts to defend structures by failing water pressure in fire hydrants; as the melting pipes in burning homes leaked, the network lost pressure despite the presence of working backup generators.\nAt 4:46p.m. HST (UTC 02:46), the fire reportedly crossed Honoapi\u02bbilani Highway (Hawaii Route 30) and entered the main part of Lahaina, forcing residents to self-evacuate with little or no notice. At this time, bumper-to-bumper traffic developed. By 5:45p.m. HST (UTC 03:45), the fire had reached the shoreline, when the United States Coast Guard first learned of people jumping into the ocean at Lahaina to escape the fire. Survivors later recalled getting trapped in a traffic jam and realizing they needed to go into the water when cars around them either caught fire or exploded.\nOfficials said that civil defense sirens were not activated during the fire even though Hawaii has the world's largest integrated outdoor siren warning system, with over 80 sirens on Maui alone meant to be used in cases of natural disasters. Several residents later told journalists that they had received no warning and did not know what was happening until they encountered smoke or flames. There had been no power or communications in Lahaina for much of the day, and authorities issued a confusing series of social media alerts which reached a small audience.\nThe death toll stood at 67 on August 11, but that number reflected only victims found outside buildings, because local authorities had waited for FEMA to send its specialized personnel to search building interiors. According to federal officials, many of the victims found outside \"were believed to have died in their vehicles\". The fire burned 2,170 acres (880ha) of land. PDC and FEMA estimated that 2,207 buildings had been destroyed, with a total of 2,719 exposed to the fires, and set the damage estimate at $5.52 billion as of August 11. The next day, Governor Josh Green announced the damage was close to $6 billion. Many historic structures were destroyed, including Waiola Church and Pioneer Inn. 86% of burned structures in L\u0101haina were residential.\nAs of August 12, at least 93 people had been confirmed dead in and around Lahaina with only 3% of the area searched. The number of dead was expected to rise further as FEMA search-and-rescue specialists searched the interiors of burned-down buildings. Very few victims have been identified.\nBy August 24, with 100% of the single-story, residential properties searched of the disaster area, 115 casualties had been confirmed with an additional 388 people missing. On September 7 officials reported that 99% of the area had been searched, with the death toll unchanged at 115 and the missing count reduced to 110. The disaster area remained restricted to authorized personnel due to unstable structures, exposed electrical wires, and potentially toxic ash and debris. The following day, the missing count was further reduced to 66 people. On September 15, the death toll was reduced from 115 to 97 as officials reported that DNA findings discovered that some of the remains came from the same victims. The number of missing persons was also reduced to 31 with only 1 addition to the list.\nOn September 25 a small number of residents were allowed to enter North Lahaina for the first time in over 6 weeks. Officials planned to remove restrictions for all areas of the city over the next one to two months, pending cleanup efforts by the EPA.\nThe Lahaina fire's death toll was the largest for a wildfire in the U.S. since the Cloquet fire of 1918, which killed 453 people.\nOn the same night as the Kula and Lahaina fires, another major fire sparked near P\u016blehu Road, north of K\u012bhei. The fire quickly spread in the direction of the prevailing winds, and by early August 9, the large fire entered northeast portions of K\u012bhei, resulting in an evacuation order for multiple communities nearby. Within the following days, firefighters fully contained the fire and all residents were advised that it was safe to return.\nA small, single acre fire ignited on August 11, which led to the evacuation of K\u0101\u02bbanapali in West Maui before it was contained that same day. Another fire in K\u0101\u02bbanapali would ignite again on August 26 and have an evacuation order placed and lifted on the same day.\nIn Hawai\u02bbi County, neighborhoods in the North and South Kohala districts of the Island of Hawai\u02bbi were evacuated due to rapidly spreading brush fires. On August 9, several other brush fires broke out near the communities of N\u0101'\u0101lehu and P\u0101hala; those fires were quickly brought under control. Hawai\u02bbi County Mayor Mitch Roth said there were no reports of injuries or destroyed homes on the Big Island.\nOn August 16, a large brushfire sprung up on the outskirts of Wahiaw\u0101 on O\u02bbahu. Though it did not burn near any houses, the fire threatened local unhoused people as well as the K\u016bkaniloko Birth Site, a location registered under the National Register of Historic Places and near-thousand year old site that is the location of the births of Hawaiian chiefs.\nThe governor of the state of Hawaii, Josh Green, referred to the Lahaina wildfires as the \"worst natural disaster\" in the history of Hawaii. It is the fifth deadliest wildfire in United States history, and the most lethal wildfire in the country since the Cloquet fire of 1918, which killed 453 people.\nAs of January26, 2024, there were 100 confirmed deaths due to the Lahaina fire on Maui, all of whom have been identified. An additional 3 individuals remain unaccounted for as of January 26, 2024. Among the dead was confirmed to be a Filipino national who was a naturalized U.S. citizen. The death toll in West Maui made it the deadliest wildfire and natural disaster ever recorded in Hawaii since statehood.\nAs of August 18, at least 67 people were injured in the fires. On August 9, at least twenty individuals were reported hospitalized at a Maui hospital. Six additional individuals, three of whom had critical burns, were reportedly transported by air ambulance from Maui to hospitals on O\u02bbahu.\nOn August 17, 60 survivors were found alive sheltering inside a single home.\nDue to DNA testing determining that victims were unintentionally being counted multiple times, the death toll officially dropped from 115 to 97 on September 18.\nThe main Maui wildfire burned much of the community of Lahaina, where more than 2,200 structures were damaged or destroyed, including much of the downtown Lahaina Historic District centered on Front Street. 96% of burned structures were residential. The 3.4-square-mile  area (8.8km) was the commercial, residential, and cultural center of the community. On August 17, Governor Green noted that the fire temperature had reached 1,000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C), since it was hot enough to melt granite counters and engine blocks.  Puddles of melted aluminum have been seen underneath burned-out vehicles.\nAlthough PDC and FEMA had initially estimated total damage at around $5.52 billion, catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. estimated on August 16 that insured property losses would be only $3.2 billion. Real estate experts expressed concern that many Lahaina homes were uninsured or underinsured and surviving owners might not have sufficient financial resources to build new homes in compliance with the state's current building code.  Many Native Hawaiians were able to afford to live in Lahaina only because they had inherited paid-off homes from previous generations, and since they had not needed mortgage loans to purchase their homes, they were not required to carry homeowners insurance coverage.\nThe Lahaina Historic District, which was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1962 and was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii for 35 years, suffered extensive fire damage. Among the structures destroyed were:\nThe fire also destroyed several cell towers in affected areas, causing service outages and 9-1-1 emergency telephone services to be rendered unavailable. The wildfire that burned near the community of Kula, located in Maui's Upcountry, destroyed at least two homes.\nThe Maria Lanakila Catholic Church in Lahaina, which had been dedicated in 1858. Contrary to early reports, the main church building and steeple were not destroyed and survived the fire largely intact, though the roof and interior may have sustained some damage.\nThe Lahaina Civic Center, venue for the Maui Invitational Tournament, a prominent early-season college men's basketball event, has so far escaped significant damage, although it had to be evacuated after earlier serving as an evacuation center. The 2023 tournament, scheduled for November, was moved to Honolulu at the Stan Sheriff Center instead.\nLahaina's famous banyan tree, the largest banyan tree in the United States, had most of its foliage charred, though was left standing after the fire. A video taken on August 11 showed local officials watering the tree to aid its recovery. At least some green foliage appeared to be present and the roots, trunks, and branches of the tree were largely undamaged.\nOn August 11, unsafe water alerts were issued as early as 3 p.m. (01:00 UTC) warning residents of Lahaina and Upper Kula, with instructions to not drink or use tap water for daily activities, even after boiling, and all residents were requested to limit water use. Following earlier deployments on August 9, further potable water tankers were set up at locations across the island. Some scientists have also warned that charred soils, toxic contaminated top soil and other debris could run off into the shoreline and cause marine habitats and coral to be damaged.\nThe fires prompted mass evacuations of thousands of residents and visitors from L\u0101haina, K\u0101\u02bbanapali, K\u012bhei, and Kula. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that they had rescued 17 people who had jumped into the sea in Lahaina to escape the fires. As of August 12, more than 1,400 people on Maui remained in shelters. Vacationing San Francisco mayor London Breed was among those evacuated from Maui.\nAn estimated 11,000 people flew out of Maui via Kahului Airport on August 9, 2023.\nAmerican, Southwest, Hawaiian, and Alaska Airlines had added additional flights to their routes into Kahului Airport by August 10 to help evacuate people from the island, and American replaced a narrow-body Airbus A321 with a wide-body Boeing 777 to further boost capacity. All four airlines had also reportedly waived fare cancellation penalties and fare-difference fees for affected passengers, and Hawaiian and Southwest offered temporary $19 interisland flights until August 11.  By August 13, 2023, over 46,000 visitors had flown out of Maui via Kahului Airport.\nHawaiian state officials created plans to house visitors along with thousands of displaced Maui residents at the Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu, O\u02bbahu and over 100 had stayed as of August 10.\nAfter the fire swept through Lahaina on August 8, Maui County blocked public access to all of West Maui with checkpoints on Route 30/340 (Honoapi\u02bbilani Highway, the only highway in and out of the area). Over the next three days, the blockade created a desperate situation for residents of still-intact communities who ran low on medicine, food, and fuel, while other residents and tourists who suddenly found themselves outside of the blockade wished to retrieve their belongings. On August 11, 2023, the County reopened the checkpoint on Route 30 at M\u0101\u02bbalaea to help ameliorate these issues. Within five hours, the checkpoint was closed again, reportedly because of attempts to enter the sealed-off portion of Lahaina.\nOn September 25 officials cleared a small area in North Lahaina for reentry, the first time in over 6 weeks that residents had been allowed back into the city. Visiting residents were provided with personal protective equipment and urged not to disturb the ash, which may contain hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead.\nThe Maui Humane Society stated that there is an estimated 3,000 animals from Lahaina that were currently missing after the fires as of August 16. As of August 14, the society had received about 367 lost animal reports and some dual reported with the society and on the \"Missing Pets of Maui\" Facebook page created by the society which has about 6,400 members. Any found animals are checked for any identification and scanned for a microchip, with the society urging that found deceased animals should not be moved or destroyed so that they can be cataloged and checked for any identification.\nAnimal welfare advocates and the Maui Police were working in tandem to search the burned areas for lost, injured or deceased animals, with dozens of feeding and drinking stations set up to draw out animals. After the fire in order to make room for animals that were impacted by the fires, the Humane Society, and the only open-admission animal shelter on the island airlifted over 100 shelter animals to Portland, Oregon. Veterinarians and staff members of the K\u012bhei Veterinary Clinic, the Humane Society, and the Central Maui Animal Clinic and volunteers coordinated care for the found animals as well as disbursing free medical care, food and animal medication to island residents. Donations and care were also extended to the Maui Police Department's K-9 unit that are working with recovery efforts and housing for the animals.\nScientists with the National Science Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began to prep for studies that would monitor and document any changes in water quality due to soil erosion and other effects of the fire that can affect the island's waterways and ecosystems. Others expressed thanks that areas such as the Maui Bird Conservation Center was spared from the majority of the fires, as it housed a large portion of the alal\u0101 flock.\nWithin two weeks of the Maui wildfires, lawyers from California, Florida, Oregon, Texas, and Washington had come to Maui to sign up wildfire victims as plaintiffs. Chief Disciplinary Counsel Bradley Tamm (the state's primary lawyer regulator) warned Hawaiians to be careful: \"It\u2019s a feeding frenzy. There are sharks both in the water and on the land\". Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc., the primary electric utility for Maui, became a significant focus of such litigation. By August 14, at least one lawsuit had been filed against Hawaiian Electric, and the company experienced a decline in its stock value.\nOn August 9, 2023, a deputy attorney general representing the Board of Land and Natural Resources filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to the Hawai'i Supreme Court, alleging that a Hawaii circuit court judge's rulings regarding private water usage had restricted the amount of water available to fight the fires. This claim was disputed by the responding Sierra Club, who requested the Supreme Court to sanction the Attorney General for filing the petition under false pretenses. The attorney representing Maui County stated during the hearing that a lack of water was never an issue during the wildfires. The Supreme Court denied the petition.\nOn October 4, 2023,  a filing with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission showed that Hawaiian Electric was underinsured against its potential liability exposure for the Maui wildfires, with only about $165 million in liability insurance coverage. According to ALM's Law.com, as of October 5, 2023, more than 35 lawsuits had been filed against Hawaiian Electric and other defendants. Most but not all had been filed in Hawaii state circuit courts, especially the Second Circuit based in Wailuku (which has jurisdiction over Maui County).  In response, Hawaiian Electric retained California law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson as its lead defense counsel. The same law firm had previously worked for Pacific Gas and Electric on litigation arising out of the 2018 California wildfires, in which its attorneys had billed their time in 2019 at rates between $400 and $1,400 per hour.\nU.S. President Joe Biden ordered the mobilization of \"all available federal assets\" to help respond to the wildfires. In a statement, Biden noted that the United States Navy Third Fleet and the United States Coast Guard were supporting \"response and rescue efforts\". The United States Department of Transportation was working with commercial airlines to help evacuate tourists from Maui. To help with the ongoing Coast Guard search and rescue operation, the United States Navy sent in Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron Three Seven (HSM-37) and two MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, with the United States Indo-Pacific Command standing ready to provide additional assistance as needed. Meanwhile, the U.S. 25th Infantry Division from Schofield Barracks on O\u02bbahu was deployed alongside the Hawaii National Guard to Maui and Hawaii Island to assist with fire suppression support, search and rescue operations, and traffic control.\nPresident Biden approved the state of Hawaii's request for a major disaster declaration on August 10, making federal funding available for recovery efforts in the affected areas. On August 10, FEMA initiated deployment of Urban Search and Rescue Task Force personnel from around the United States to Maui. Washington State Task Force 1 sent 45 specialists along with a 5-member K-9 team. Each human member of the K-9 team works with a canine partner, a FEMA-certified human remains detection dog. The same task force had previously deployed to Maui in 2018 to assist with the aftermath of Hurricane Lane. On August 10, Nevada Task Force 1 was initially asked to send one K-9 handler and dog, who left that same day. The request was amended to four more specialists, then on top of that, a full 45-member task force team, all of whom flew out on August 11.\nFEMA initially provided $700 payments as one of several types of federal assistance available to survivors of the wildfire, which was meant to address immediate needs such as food, water, and clothing.\nCalifornia sent 11 members of Urban Search and Rescue task forces based in the cities of Sacramento, Riverside, and Oakland, and six employees of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. On August 15, California announced that it was increasing its deployment to 101 people, including an incident management team of 67 Cal Fire employees.  Among the new personnel arriving on Maui were forensic anthropologists from Chico State who had helped identify victims of the Camp Fire (2018).\nBy August 16, the number of FEMA cadaver dogs deployed to the scene had increased to 40, and Governor Green explained that the searchers were in a \"race against time\" to recover remains before they could be degraded by the next rainstorm.  Each dog could only work for about 15 to 20 minutes in the tropical heat before rotating into an air-conditioned truck to cool down. The dogs also had to wear booties to shield their paws from asphalt temperatures exceeding 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) and still-hot embers, but the booties themselves required frequent replacement.\nMeanwhile, on August 15, a federal Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT) arrived on the island to assist with the identification and processing of the large number of remains. The DMORT brought along a portable morgue in the form of 22.5 short tons (20,400kg) of equipment and supplies, and nine Matson shipping containers were seen outside the Maui Police Department's Forensic Facility in Wailuku.\nOn August 17, a five-member National Response Team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrived on Maui to investigate the cause and origin of the Lahaina fire.  The team included an electrical engineer from the Fire Research Laboratory.\nOn August 21, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden arrived at Kahului Airport, where they met with Governor Josh Green, his wife Jaime, as well as members of Hawaii's congressional delegation. The Bidens then boarded Marine One where they were given an aerial tour of the devastation.  Biden then went to Lahaina where he met with first responders as well as local and state officials and FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. The Bidens walked through the ruins of the town seeing the area firsthand. They also took part in a blessing by island elders. Biden then spoke to the community and met with survivors at the Lahaina Civic Center.\nBy August 25, the FEMA Urban Search and Rescue task forces had searched 99% of the disaster area, and they wrapped up their work and returned home to the mainland United States.\nHawaii Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke, who was serving as acting governor in the absence of Governor Josh Green while he was traveling outside of Hawaii, issued an emergency proclamation and activated the Hawaii National Guard. The Hawaii National Guard, together with the U.S. 25th Infantry Division from Schofield Barracks on O\u02bbahu, deployed to Maui and Hawaii Island to assist with fire suppression support, search and rescue operations, and traffic control. Two UH-60 Blackhawk and one CH-47 Chinook helicopters were also deployed to support fire suppression efforts.\nAs of August9, 2023, the Hawaii Tourism Authority was asking all visitors on Maui for non-essential travel to leave the island and strongly discouraged any further non-essential travel to the island.\nPreviously closed to prioritize emergency services, access to West Maui via Honoapi\u02bbilani Highway for residents with proof of residency and visitors with proof of hotel reservations was resumed beginning at 12 p.m. (UTC 22:00) on August 11. However, at 4 p.m. (UTC 02:00) access was again restricted due to reports of people accessing restricted areas despite hazardous conditions. Access was reopened the following day through Waihee (from the north) only.\nOn August 11, Hawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez announced that her department would conduct a \"comprehensive review of critical decision-making and standing policies\" surrounding the wildfires.\nOn August 16, Governor Josh Green announced his intention to create a moratorium on the sale of land damaged and destroyed by the fires. While acknowledging there may be legal challenges to such a moratorium, he asked \"please don't approach them with an offer to buy land. Please don't approach their families to tell them that they are going to be better off if they make a deal, because we're not going to allow it.\"\nOn August 31, Attorney General Lopez disclosed in an interview that her office had hired UL's Fire Safety Research Institute to conduct an independent investigation on behalf of the state government, and the UL investigators had been on scene in Maui since August 24.\nJapan pledged $2 million of aid, with $1.5 million given to the American Red Cross and $500,000 given to the Tokyo-based nonprofit organization Japan Platform.\nSouth Korea pledged $2 million of aid in support relief efforts. The pledge included a $1.5 million donation to the Hawai\u2018i Community Foundation and $500,000 of supplies purchased from local Korean markets.\nThe Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Honolulu announced a $500,000 cash donation to the Hawai\u2018i Community Foundation to support relief efforts.\nA container city on the island of Maui is being built from foldable container units.\nDue to multiple GoFundMe fundraising efforts for those that were affected by the fires, the site put together a hub to gather all of the verified fundraisers, and added that by August 18 there had been more than 250,000 donors and $30 million raised through the site for those affected. Other organizations, communities and businesses across the United States held donation drives and fundraisers where proceeds and the items would be donated to specific nonprofits or groups. All twelve professional sports teams from the Los Angeles area donated $450,000 to relief efforts. In addition, proceeds from the October 8 preseason game at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Utah Jazz will go towards the Maui Strong Fund.\nThe Hawaiian Mission Houses Archives has uploaded items to their digitization project relevant to Lahaina's history such as photos, journals, drawings, and letters to aid in the recovery of historic sites.\nA lack of adequate warning and preparation has also come into focus. Despite Hawaii's advanced integrated outdoor siren warning system, on Maui, 80 of these sirens, designed for tsunamis and other disasters, remained silent as the fires burned. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency attributed the lack of activation to the fires' rapid progression and existing ground response coordination. And while residents received other alerts, such as mobile phone notifications, the intensity and urgency of these messages were deemed insufficient. At least one analyst compared them unfavorably to high-priority tsunami warnings, suggesting a possible alarm fatigue among residents, where frequent, less urgent alerts can diminish the perceived significance of real threats. The administrator of the Maui County Emergency Management Agency, Herman Andaya, defended the decision not to activate the emergency sirens in an August 16 press conference; he argued that the outdoor sirens exist only on the coastline and are normally used to warn residents to flee tsunamis by heading to the mountainside, which would have sent them straight into the fire. Andaya resigned the next day effective immediately, citing health reasons.\nThe Lahaina wildfires also exposed gaps in the state's wildfire preparedness. In a 2021 report, Hawaii officials ranked wildfire risk as \"low\" despite increasing fire acreage and dangers from drought and non-native grasses. The report criticized inadequate funding and lack of fire prevention strategies. Previous wildfires served as a warning, but risks were not adequately addressed. Hawaii's fire management budgets had not kept pace with growing threats, according to the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization. Non-native, flammable grasses remained widespread, increasing fire risk. The climatologist Abby Frazier emphasized Hawaii's extreme wildfire vulnerability and called for more serious fire prevention efforts. The 2021 Maui County report had recommended fire hazard risk assessment and replacing non-native grasses, but it is unclear if these recommendations were implemented.\nA state official for the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources delayed the request of the release of water by the West Maui Land Co. to protect its holdings until it was too late. In early September, it was reported that residents of numerous communities around the state of Hawaii had become deeply worried about the risk of losing their own homes to wildfires, after seeing how Lahaina had been so suddenly destroyed.\nFollowing the fires, a variety of conspiracy theories about them were posted to social media, notably by far-right conspiracy theorist Stew Peters. Some contained doctored images or images and videos of other unrelated events presented as being from the fires, often ostensibly demonstrating that a directed-energy weapon or \"space laser\" was involved. There have also been mentions of famous individuals' estates in Hawaii that have not been damaged from the fires, prompting unsubstantiated accusations of blame. Other posts have claimed that wildfires do not occur naturally or that vegetation is not left standing in a natural fire. Real Raw News, a fake news website, promoted falsehoods about U.S. Marines attacking a FEMA convoy fleeing the wildfires and arresting FEMA deputy administrator Erik Hooks.\nResearchers from Microsoft, Recorded Future, the RAND Corporation, NewsGuard and the University of Maryland found that a Chinese government-directed disinformation campaign used the disaster to attempt to sow discord in the US. Lahaina residents were discouraged from going to the agencies for assistance by disinformation from people who regularly spread Russian propaganda.",

        "title": "Hurricane Hilary",
        "text": "Hurricane Hilary was a large and powerful Pacific hurricane in August 2023 that brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to the Pacific Coast of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula, and the Southwestern United States, resulting in widespread flooding and mudslides. The cyclone was the eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season. Hilary originated from a tropical wave south of Mexico on August16, and strengthened into a hurricane a day later while paralleling the southwest coast of Mexico. The hurricane underwent rapid intensification, reaching maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a central pressure of 940mbar (27.76inHg) on August18, making it a Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. After environmental conditions became unfavorable, Hilary weakened as it approached land, making landfall as a tropical storm in San Quint\u00edn along the western Baja California peninsula, becoming post-tropical before being absorbed into a new system shortly after.\nIn anticipation of \"catastrophic and life-threatening flooding\", the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, extending from the Mexico\u2013United States border to just north of Los Angeles. Persistent heavy rainfall, potentially \"more than a year\u2019s worth of rain\" in some areas, was forecasted. Due to this, flood watches were issued, affecting about 26million people across four states (Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah), and the entire region was placed under a high risk threat for flash flooding by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).\nIn Mexico, the hurricane killed two people due to floodwaters, and left 250million pesos (US$14.7million) in damage. The storm left behind flooded roads, mudslides and downed trees in the Baja California peninsula and in Southern California. Some areas of the latter region received up to 600% of their annual rainfall averages for the month of August. The floods killed one person in San Bernardino County, California. Damage in the United States were estimated at US$900million, much of it in Inyo County, California, where most of the roads in Death Valley National Park were damaged by floods. Even so, its overall impact on the region was less severe than initially feared. Hilary broke records in four U.S. states for wettest tropical cyclone or its remnants.\nThe origins of Hilary was from a tropical wave that exited the western coast of Africa around August3. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Lesser Antilles by August9. On that day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first identified the potential for the eventual development, 156hours before Hilary's formation. The tropical wave crossed Central America into the far eastern Pacific Ocean on August12, producing a large area of disorganized convection, or thunderstorms. As early as August13, hurricane prediction models anticipated a tropical cyclone would affect Mexico and the southwestern United States. A low pressure area developed on August14 south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, as the thunderstorms gradually organized. After a low-level circulation formed early on August16, the system developed into a tropical depression by 06:00UTC, located about 345mi (555km) south of Acapulco. Six hours later, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and the NHC named it Hilary.\nUpon its formation, Hilary was moving northwestward, steered by a ridge over Mexico. Atmospheric and environmental conditions were conducive for further strengthening, including warm sea surface temperatures of near 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), ample moisture, and low wind shear. Accordingly, the NHC warned that Hilary had a high likelihood of rapid intensification. Convection around the storm increased and organized into a central dense overcast, with an eye developing in the center. On August17, Hilary intensified into a hurricane, by which time it had expanded into a large tropical cyclone, with tropical storm-force winds extending 230mi (370km) from the center. Symmetric outflow and pronounced rainbands developed around the hurricane. Early on August18, Hilary intensified into a major hurricane, or a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The convection around the center organized into a thick ring around the eye. At 06:00UTC that day, the NHC estimated that Hilary attained a peak intensity of 140mph (220km/h), making it a Category4, while its barometric pressure dropped to 940mbar (28inHg). The intensity estimate was based on satellite imagery using the Dvorak technique. By the time of its peak, Hilary commenced a 48hour period of intensification following its development.\nAfter reaching its peak intensity, Hilary weakened slightly due to an eyewall replacement cycle, in which the inner eye collapsed as the larger, outer eyewall contracted. The Hurricane Hunters first investigated the storm late on August18, by which time Hilary fell to Category3 intensity. Around that time, the hurricane began moving more to the northwest, reaching the western periphery of the ridge over Mexico. Another Hurricane Hunters flight on August19 observed that Hilary re-intensified into a Category4 hurricane, with a secondary peak of 130mph (215km/h), and a pressure of 943mbar (27.8inHg). Thereafter, drier and stable air began affecting the hurricane, along with cooler water temperatures, causing the eye to fall apart. Hilary quickly weakened as it accelerated north-northward, responding to the steering influences of a trough of low pressure near the California coast and a ridge of high pressure over the central United States. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on August20, as wind shear from the trough displaced the thunderstorms far north of the center. At around 17:00UTC that day, Hilary made landfall in a sparsely-populated region of northwestern Mexico in the state of Baja California, with sustained winds estimated at 60mph (95km/h). This was about 215mi (345km) south-southeast of San Diego, California.\nAfter moving ashore, Hilary's circulation became elongated and disrupted over the mountainous terrain of Baja California. Devoid of convection, Hilary degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone, and soon after was absorbed by a low pressure area developing near the southern coast of California, outside of outside of Hilary's wind radius. The NHC tracked the two systems as the same, assessing that Hilary continued into southern California as a tropical storm, which would have had made it the first tropical storm to cross into the state since Nora in 1997. The remnants of Hilary continued moving through the western United States, eventually crossing into Canada. In February 2024, former chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ryan Maue, stated that Hurricane Hilary was \u201can unprecedented \"climate change-fueled disaster\" juiced up by El Ni\u00f1o\u201d.\nThe Mexican government issued watches for southern Baja California Sur on August17. They were upgraded to warnings later that day. Hurricane watches were issued for western parts of the Baja California peninsula at 03:00 UTC on August 18, and by 15:00 UTC the same day, they were upgraded to hurricane warnings as hurricane watches were issued for the west coast of Baja California.\nNearly 1,900people in Mexico evacuated to shelters along the Baja California peninsula. This included about 850people evacuated by the Mexican Navy from five offshore islands. Several schools in Cabo San Lucas were used as temporary shelters, and 18,000soldiers were on alert. Officials closed ports from Oaxaca to Colima on August17, and later extended closures to Baja California Sur. School classes and public activities were cancelled in Baja California, with a baseball game postponed. Around 20 flights were cancelled at Los Cabos International Airport. Beaches were closed in La Paz, Tijuana, and Ensenada.\nOn August15, five days before Hilary's landfall and a day before the system was named, local National Weather Service (NWS) offices in California first released videos and briefings related to the potential impacts. The first issued a flood watch on August17 for the mountain and desert regions of southern California. A day later, the NHC issued its first-ever tropical storm watch for Southern California, later upgraded to a tropical storm warning. The Weather Prediction Center (WPC) also issued a level 4/high risk for excessive rainfall, which was the first ever high risk of flash flooding in the desert valleys of Southern California east of the Peninsular Ranges. The NWS issued a flood watch for portions of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, affecting about 26million people. WPC forecaster David Roth described the rainfall potential as \"exceedingly rare, bordering on unique, for the region from a tropical cyclone and unique for Nevada, which had its first ever High Risk WPC Day issued for the state\". Roth expected a broad area would experience 1-in-100year rainfall totals. The NWS also issued flash flood warnings for San Bernardino and Kern counties.\nOn August20, the Storm Prediction Center issued a level 2/slight risk in Southern California, which included 5% risk of tornadoes. That night, a tornado warning was issued for Alpine and Descanso in San Diego County. The WPC later forecast the chance for 5 inches (130mm) of rainfall in the mountains of Idaho from the system. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) staff and personnel were ordered to be positioned in southern California by President Joe Biden, and Biden urged residents and people in the storm's path to take precautions. An emergency operations center was opened in San Diego and Los Angeles.\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for southern California. Local states of emergency were declared in Los Angeles, Palm Springs, and in Indio. The California National Guard preemptively deployed to multiple locations across southern California on August19. The American Red Cross opened shelters in Imperial, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties. Emergency shelters were also opened by local governments in Yucca Valley and Twentynine Palms. Nevada governor Joe Lombardo deployed 100 National Guard and Nevada National Guard troops to assist southern Nevada impacted by severe weather associated with Hilary. Lombardo also declared a state of emergency, along with emergencies in Clark and Nye counties. The United States Navy moved carriers and ships out to sea and out of Hilary's path, including the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and to park aircraft in hangars. The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation announced that all parks and facilities were closed for two days. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department advised all people to leave Catalina Island on August 19, while Avalon Bay was closed to boats and ships. Additional resources were deployed to the island by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Los Angeles County Fire Department. On August19, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department issued evacuation warnings for Oak Glen, Forest Falls, Mountain Home Village, Angelus Oaks and northeast Yucaipa. Officials issued a voluntary evacuation order for residents around the Salton Sea, due to the potential for flooding. Evacuation warnings were also issued for Orange County, including areas near the Bond Fire scar. Parts of Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead were closed.\nAmtrak cancelled its August 19 run of the westbound Sunset Limited due to the storm; the eastbound August 20 run was also cancelled with its Texas Eagle attachment originating in San Antonio. They also truncated the August 19 runs of westbound Southwest Chief and the southbound Coast Starlight to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Emeryville, California, respectively. The August 20 runs of these two trains going eastbound and westbound respectively would also originate from these locations. Numerous Pacific Surfliner trains were also cancelled, forced to run on modified schedules, or delayed between August 19\u201321 as well. The launch for Falcon 9 and Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base near Los Angeles was postponed by SpaceX. Numerous airlines offered travel waivers to airports in southern California, after at least 1,000 flights were cancelled and 3,700 were delayed across the region. Affected airports included Palm Springs, Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Burbank, Long Beach, Ontario, Orange County, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and San Diego.\nMajor League Baseball rescheduled three games in advance of Hilary: one each for the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Los Angeles Angels. Major League Soccer home games for the LA Galaxy and Los Angeles FC were also rescheduled. Del Mar Racetrack canceled the race meeting scheduled on August20. This is only the second time in the 84-year track's history that such a cancellation occurred. In addition, no live audience was permitted to attend the August20 games for VALORANT Champions Los Angeles at the Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall. Ongoing strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA were cancelled for Monday in Los Angeles in preparation for Hilary. A concert at the Hollywood Bowl was postponed, and all Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation areas were closed. Disneyland and Disney California Adventure were closed early. Legoland California, SeaWorld San Diego and San Diego Zoo were closed on August20. The Los Angeles Zoo, Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Knott's Berry Farm were also closed. California State University, Los Angeles and California State University, Fullerton canceled classes on August21. All campuses in the Bear Valley Unified School District were closed on August21. On August20, the Los Angeles Unified School District announced that campuses would be closed the following day. Several schools in Orange County were closed. Fullerton College was closed as well, and schools across the Anaheim Union High School District, Anaheim Elementary School District, and the South Orange County Community College District were also closed. DoorDash temporarily suspended operations in numerous areas across southern California.\nFrom its genesis to its dissipation, Hilary's outer rainbands affected much of western Mexico as far southeast as Oaxaca. Offshore western Mexico, Hurricane Hilary passed west Socorro Island near the time of its peak intensity, producing wind gusts of 79mph (128mph). Along the Baja California peninsula, Hilary produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds. The heaviest rainfall was 12.83inches (326mm), recorded in San Lucas Norte in northeastern Baja California Sur, which was 180% of the average annual rainfall for the state. High rains caused flooding and landslides across the peninsula. Rainfall spread across the peninsula and into the adjacent states of Sonora and Sinaloa. The highest wind gust in Mexico was recorded by a high-altitude anemometer in Sierra de la Laguna, which recorded wind gusts of 99mph (159km/h) at an elevation of 6,395ft (1,949m). Closer to sea level, wind gusts reached 69mph (111km/h) at Loreto International Airport along the peninsula's eastern coast. Tropical storm-force winds extended into the state of Sonora, where Mar de Cort\u00e9s International Airport recorded gusts of 66mph (105km/h).\nCoastal areas of Sinaloa recorded torrential rains from the hurricane's passage, with its first fatality reported on August18 in Navolato when an SUV and its driver were washed away.\nOn August 28, the government of Baja California Sur calculated the damage statewide to be 250million pesos (US$14.7million).\nTorrential rainfall caused widespread flooding and landslides in Baja California Sur. One man died in Santa Rosal\u00eda, when his vehicle was washed away by floodwaters. Officials in Baja California reported numerous mud and rock slides across the state along with several power outages.\nThe remnants of Hilary moved through the western United States, producing rainfall from California as far north as Montana. The maximum recorded precipitation of 13.07in (332mm) at Upper Mission Creek in southeastern California. Damage nationwide was estimated at US$900million.\nThe system's push toward Southern California coincided with a 5.1magnitude earthquake that struck north of Los Angeles near Ojai, California, along with numerous aftershocks. Only minor damage and no injuries were reported from the quakes. As a result, the term \"hurriquake\" trended on social media.\nWhile Hilary approached and dissipated near Southern California, the storm produced locally high winds along with heavy rainfall, with some desert locations receiving more than half of their annual rainfall in a single day. The strongest gusts were recorded in Los Angeles County\u2013 87mph (140km/h) at Magic Mountain, and San Diego County\u2013 84mph (135km/h) at Big Black Mountain. High winds knocked down at least 50power poles in the town of Thermal. The highest rain totals were recorded in the San Bernardino Mountains\u2013 11.73in (298mm) at Raywood Flats, and the San Jacinto Mountains\u2013 11.74in (298mm) at Mount San Jacinto. Floodwaters in the community of Angelus Oaks swept away a mobile home, killing a woman. The remnants of Hilary set rainfall records across the state. Rainfall at Furnace Creek in Death Valley totaled 2.20in (56mm), setting a new single-day rainfall record; the amount was more than the annual average rainfall of 2.15in (55mm). On August20, downtown Los Angeles and San Diego each recorded its wettest single summer day on record (June through August) with 2.48in (63mm) and 1.82in (46mm) of precipitation, respectively. Palm Springs recorded 3.18in (81mm), also a single summer day record amount, or 69% of its average annual rainfall.\nThe collective impacts of downed trees and floods damaged or washed away roads in 13counties across California, from San Diego and Imperial counties along the state's southern border with Mexico to Siskiyou County in far northern California. The California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) estimated the cost to repair roads at over $146million. Portions of I-8, I-10, I-15, the Pacific Coast Highway, and other roads closed due to floods and rockslides. Closed state roads included portions of routes 14, 38, 58, 127, 136, 178, and 190. All roads in Death Valley National Park were severely damaged by flash flooding, with damage estimated at $500million in Inyo County alone, forcing the park to close for two months. Flash floods also damaged roads and trails in Mojave National Preserve. Farther north, heavy rain produced mudslides and flash flooding in Siskiyou County near Mount Shasta, damaging roads and rains.\nDamage in Riverside County totaled $126million, including about $83million in damaged roads and bridges, and about $26million affecting water systems. That made it the costliest natural disaster in the history of the county, with much of it occurring in the Coachella Valley. Across the valley, 9-1-1 phone service was down for a few days, which required residents to either text or call alternate numbers for emergencies. A nearly 30mi (48km) stretch of Interstate 10 (I-10) closed for two days from the floods, mud, and debris, which stranded hundreds of vehicles, and made it difficult to travel to Palm Springs. At least six state highways in Riverside County were closed due to floods, debris flow, or rockslides. Floods washed out a bridge over the Mias Canyon, isolating residents in Oak Glen. Along the Whitewater River, floodwaters 15ft (4.6m) deep damaged a bridge, derailed eight train cars, and buried another train in mud. In Palm Desert, floodwaters displaced at least 30residents in the Spanish Walk neighborhood. Also in Palm Desert, high winds knocked down a large tree, blocking a portion of SR 111. In Cathedral City, floodwaters entered a nursing home, requiring 14people to be rescued by loaders. At least 10people in Thermal evacuated to shelters. Floodwaters entered Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, but this did not impact operations there. In Palm Springs, the floods inundated vehicles, while downed power lines sparked a few small fires.\nIn San Diego, the heavy rainfall caused the San Diego River to quickly rise to a crest of 9.6ft (2.9m). City firefighters rescued a group of 13people from a flooded homeless camp along the river, while the Harbor Police rescued two people from a boat washed against Harbor Island. Floodwaters washed out a portion of SR 78 at Yaqui Pass. High winds overturned a semi-trailer truck near Borrego Springs. In La Habra in Orange County, the winds damaged housing shingles. About 41,000customers were left without electricity across the Los Angeles area. Also in the city, a mudslide damaged the Marlton School. Across the Imperial Valley, high winds downed trees and power poles, as well as damaging a gas station canopy in El Centro. Damage in Imperial County reached $9.3million. In Barstow, a lightning strike knocked down a power pole onto I-15, closing the highway. The storm spawned a microburst in Fresno, producing winds of 55mph (89km/h), which knocked down 50trees at the Belmont Country Club. Winds also knocked down a power pole and electric lines in the city.\nLocally heavy rainfall spread across much of the western United States from the remnants of Hilary. Arizona received much less precipitation from Hilary than forecasted, only peaking at (2.10in (53mm) in Hilltop. However, records for wettest (total rainfall) tropical cyclones and their remnants were broken in four states: Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon. The strongest winds beyond California primarily occurred in Nevada and Utah at high-elevation locations above 9,000ft (2,700m). In a mountainous area near Mount Charleston, in Clark County, Nevada, wind gusts reached 82mph (132km/h), strong enough to knock down a few trees. The weather station at Cardiff Pass in Utah recorded a gust of 75mph (121km/h). Thunderstorms produced high winds near Weiser, Idaho, reaching 69mph (111km/h), strong enough to knock down a few trees.\nThe new mark in Nevada was more than double the previous record, with 9.20in (234mm) recorded in Lee Canyon. Across Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and nearby mountainous areas, the rains produced flash flooding, which washed away roads, underground pipes, a fire station, and trails. The damage, estimated at $25million, closed the recreation area until October26, when Nevada State Route 156 (Lee Canyon Road) was reopened. The community of Mount Charleston had to shelter in place after electricity and road access were cut off. The town's fire department was inundated with mud, with houses and a nearby school damaged. A landslide also damaged part of Lee Canyon Ski and Snowboard Resort. Floods closed a portion of U.S. Route 95 in Nevada in Nye County. The rains rose the water levels in Lake Mead by 0.16in (4.1mm). In eastern Washington, rain from the system was beneficial with helping extinguish the 2023 Washington wildfires.\nDue to storm damage, Riverside County announced in September 2023 the availability of tax relief for property owners incurring more than $10,000 in damage, while also opening an office in Yucaipa to provide assistance to the public. On October3, the United States Small Business Administration opened a Disaster Loan Outreach Center in Angelus Oaks, to provide loans to homes and businesses affected by the storm. On October5, the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration announced the release of $15.3million in emergency funds to help rebuild roads and bridges in 12California counties. On November22, U.S. President Joe Biden announced a major disaster declaration for five California counties affected by the storm: Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Riverside and Siskiyou. The announcement provided federal funding for emergency work toward repairing or replacing damaged public facilities. On December14, the Palm Desert city council authorized a $4.63million contract to expand a water retention basin by about 36%, near where I-10 was flooded. The project was intended to withstand the 100year flood. Following heavy rainfall in Death Valley, floodwaters reformed the ancient Lake Manly in what the usually dry Badwater Basin, lasting several months. In the Mount Charleston region of Nevada, workers spent $11million to reopen roads to the mountainous communities. At the Lee Canyon Ski Resort, workers used dump trucks to restore damaged ski slopes, reopening the resort on November4.",

        "title": "2023 Johannesburg building fire",
        "text": "On 31 August 2023 at around 01:30 SAST, a fire engulfed an illegally occupied government-owned building in Johannesburg, South Africa; 77 people were killed and 88 others were injured. It was one of the deadliest fires in South African history.\nThe building, 80 Albert Street, was built in 1954 as the head office of Johannesburg's Non-European Affairs Department, serving as a Pass Office for enforcing pass laws controlling the movement of black people into Johannesburg under the apartheid system. From 1994, the building housed a women's shelter later called the Usindiso Women's Shelter. In 2019, a clinic housed in the building was relocated by the member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Health and Social Development, Mpho Phalatse, as the building was occupied by squatters and found to be unsafe.\nThe building is marked with a heritage plaque narrating its history.\nThe fire broke out in the early hours of the morning on 31 August 2023, in the Central Business District, at a five-storey abandoned building on the corner of Delvers and Albert Streets that is owned by the city government and was taken over by gangs. It was being illegally occupied by as many as 400 impoverished people\u2014many of them foreign nationals, economic migrants, and asylum seekers\u2014all of whom were being charged rent by the gangs. The cause of the fire is not currently known. It spread through the building, trapping many people due to flimsy partitions and gates between makeshift rooms constructed by residents.\nMany residents jumped from the windows of the building to escape, some of whom did not survive the jump. Firefighters found bodies piled up where they had died at a locked gate on the ground floor while trying to exit the burning building.\nThe fire brought attention to the hundreds of hijacked buildings in the Johannesburg CBD, typically overcrowded and unregulated and inhabited by impoverished and marginalised people including a large number of undocumented migrants to South Africa's economic hub of Johannesburg.\nSome residents who survived the fire refused to board buses for relocation to emergency accommodation in community halls after the fire, fearing the relocation would be used by officials as an excuse for deportation, and being unwilling to leave behind the remains of their possessions in the burnt building.\nIn January 2024, a 29-year-old man was arrested after he confessed to starting the fire. The man said he started the fire in order to get rid of another murder victim's body on the orders of a Tanzanian drug dealer who also lived in the building. He is currently facing 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa visited the site of the tragedy on 31 August, calling it a \"wake-up call\". Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi announced an inquiry into the fire. While government officials blamed the crisis on NGOs, who prevented the previous attempts to evict occupiers from similar properties, NGOs and inner city property owners argued that it was the duty of the City of Johannesburg to maintain buildings, provide services and enforce safety regulations. South Africa's courts have consistently ruled that evictions cannot proceed unless alternative housing is provided under the provisions of the 1998 Prevention of Illegal Eviction Act. Following the fire, the City attempted to disconnect illegal electricity connections from similar hijacked buildings in the city, but was met with strong resistance from residents.",

        "title": "2023 Al Haouz earthquake",
        "text": "On 8 September 2023 at 23:11 DST (22:11 UTC), an earthquake with a moment magnitude of 6.9 and maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent) struck Morocco's Al Haouz Province. The earthquake's epicenter was 73.4km (45.6mi) southwest of Marrakesh, near the town of Ighil and the Ouka\u00efmeden ski resort in the Atlas Mountains. It occurred as a result of shallow oblique-thrust faulting beneath the mountain range. At least 2,960 deaths were reported, with most occurring outside Marrakesh. Damage was widespread, and historic landmarks in Marrakesh were destroyed. The earthquake was also felt in Spain, Portugal, and Algeria.\nIt is the strongest instrumentally recorded earthquake in Morocco, the deadliest in the country since the 1960 Agadir earthquake, and the second-deadliest earthquake of 2023 after the Turkey\u2013Syria earthquakes. Its magnitude also makes it the largest earthquake on the African continent since the 2006 Mw\u202f 7.0 Mozambique earthquake and the largest in North Africa since the 1980 Mw\u202f 7.1 El Asnam earthquake. Over 2.8 million people from Marrakesh and areas surrounding the Atlas Mountains were affected, including 100,000 children. Following the earthquake, many countries offered humanitarian assistance, and Morocco announced a three-day period of national mourning.\nMorocco lies close to the Azores\u2013Gibraltar Transform Fault, which is the boundary between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This zone of right-lateral strike-slip becomes transpressional at its eastern end, with the development of large thrust faults. To the east of the Strait of Gibraltar, in the Alboran Sea, the boundary becomes collisional in type. Most of the seismicity in Morocco is related to movement on that plate boundary, with the greatest seismic hazard in the north of the country close to the boundary. In 2004, Al Hoceima was struck by a magnitude 6.3 earthquake that killed 628 people and left 926 injured. A magnitude 7.3 earthquake affecting neighboring Algeria in 1980 killed 2,500 people.\nThe Atlas Mountains are an intracontinental mountain belt that extends 2,000km (1,200mi) from Morocco to Tunisia. These mountains formed from a collision during the Cenozoic. The mountain range reaches its highest elevation to the west, in Morocco. The High Atlas formed during the reactivation of an ancient rift from the Triassic. However rather than extensional forces, the reactivation compressed the rift feature due to the collisional feature in the north.\nSeismicity in Morocco is concentrated in the country's northern region and the Alboran Sea. South of the Rif, seismic activity is sparse but spread across the Middle Atlas, High Atlas, and Anti-Atlas. Seismicity in the Saharan Atlas is limited, and absent in the Saharan region south of the belt; it is also less active eastwards in Algeria and Tunisia. Previously, the largest earthquake recorded in the Atlas Mountains was the Mw\u202f 5.9 earthquake that struck Agadir in 1960. Earthquakes in the Atlas Mountains display focal mechanisms of strike-slip, thrust or a combination of both (oblique-slip).\nThe Marrakesh\u2013Safi earthquake is the strongest instrumentally recorded in Morocco's history, surpassed only by upper estimates of the 1755 Meknes earthquake, at Mw 6.5\u20137.0. It occurred at 19.0km (11.8mi) depth, and had a magnitude of Mww\u202f6.8, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), while Morocco's seismic agency reported a focal depth of 8km (5.0mi) and magnitude of Mwp 7.2. The Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) reported a magnitude of Mw\u202f6.9. The tremors were detected by monitoring stations as far away as Egypt. Witnesses said the shaking lasted for about 20 seconds. A magnitude 4.9 aftershock occurred 19 minutes after the mainshock, while a magnitude 4.5 aftershock was reported on 10 September.\nThe earthquake had a focal mechanism indicating oblique-thrust faulting beneath the High Atlas. The rupture occurred on a steep-dipping oblique-reverse fault striking northwest or a shallow-dipping oblique-reverse fault striking east. The USGS estimated the fault rupture area to be 30km (19mi) by 25km (16mi). Many east-west and northeast\u2013southwest strike-slip and thrust faults occur in the High Atlas. Since 1900, there has not been a Mw\u202f 6.0 or larger earthquake within 500km (310mi) of the recent earthquake's epicentre; but nine Mw\u202f 5.0 and larger events have occurred to its east. A finite fault model by the USGS indicates rupture occurred on an east-northeast\u2013west-southwest striking, north\u2013northwest dipping thrust fault. Slip was mostly concentrated around the hypocentre within an elliptical slip patch measuring about 30km (19mi) long by 25km (16mi) wide. A maximum displacement of 1.9m (6ft 3in) was observed at 25km (16mi) depth while significant slip mainly occurred at 20\u201330km (12\u201319mi) depth; there was little to no slip close to the surface above 15km (9.3mi) depth. Generally, slip was observed at 15km (9.3mi) to 35km (22mi) depth.\nIn another finite fault model published by Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the focal depth was determined at 24.7km (15.3mi) beneath the High Atlas. The focal mechanism of this model displayed reverse and left-lateral faulting. Slip occurred in an elliptical area along an east-northeast\u2013west-southwest trending fault dipping 69\u00b0 north\u2013northwest. Peak slip of 2m (6ft 7in) occurred at 23.3km (14.5mi).\nGeodetic modeling suggests the earthquake originated from within the lower crust and ruptured up to the middle crust, beneath the High Atlas. The deeper depth and greater remoteness from populated areas compared to the earthquake that struck Agadir in 1960 meant fewer casualties and damage. The range of depth where slip occurred is unusually deep for crustal earthquakes although general seismicity in the area is low.\nAs a result, no surface faulting occurred hence the fault responsible could not be identified. The focal mechanism suggests rupture on a steep north-dipping plane or shallow south-dipping plane. The USGS finite fault is aligned with the former solution. Two dominant systems; the North and South Atlas faults; both shallow-dipping thrust faults, occur in the western High Atlas; both fault geometries do not align with that of the USGS finite fault on a steeply-dipping plane. Other unmapped faults within the range, including the Tizi n\u2019Test Fault, are closer to the surface projection of the USGS finite fault. If the rupture occurred on the shallow south-dipping plane, a possible source is a low\u2010angle detachment beneath the High Atlas. Geologists have previously interpreted low-angle faults in the region in past studies. For the steep north\u2010dipping plane, the possible source are unmapped or blind thrust faults.\nVertical movement of the land surface detected by repeat observations of the Sentinel-1 satellite is consistent with movement on a blind thrust fault dipping north. The Tizi n\u2019Test Fault, a north-dipping geological fault, may have been responsible for the earthquake. No recent activity had previously been identified along the fault. An analysis of satellite data obtained from Daichi-2 by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan revealed a 20cm (7.9in) uplift of the surface around the epicenter and to the south, 7cm (2.8in) of subsidence. Surface deformation was observed around the epicenter in area measuring 50km (31mi) east and west, and 100km (62mi) north and south.\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey's PAGER service, the earthquake had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). Intensity VIII (Severe) shaking was felt by approximately 157,000 residents, including the town of Azgour and villages surrounding the Atlas Mountains. Intensity VII (Very Strong) shaking was felt by over 811,000 people, with intensity VI (Strong) shaking felt by 3.2 million residents, including in the cities of Marrakesh, Taroudant and Ouarzazate. Shaking of intensity V (Moderate) was felt in Agadir, Beni Mellal, and Safi, with intensity IV (Light) shaking being felt in Casablanca. According to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre, it was also felt in Portugal, Spain, Mauritania, Algeria, Western Sahara and along the coast of the Strait of Gibraltar.\nAt least 2,960 people were killed and 5,674 were injured; over 2,500 of the injured were seriously hurt. Many fatalities occurred in remote locations south of Marrakesh. In Al-Haouz and Taroudant provinces, the death toll stood at 1,684 and 980, respectively. Forty-one people died in Ouarzazate; 202 died in Chichaoua and 18 deaths were recorded in Marrakesh. There were also fatalities in Casablanca, Agadir and Youssoufia. One person was injured by rockfalls in Imi N'Tala following a magnitude 3.5 aftershock on 13 September. At least 40,759 houses and 2,930 villages were damaged; 19,095 additional houses collapsed.\nFour French nationals and a British cyclist were among the fatalities. Fifteen French nationals and some Americans were injured. In Moulay Brahim, residents became trapped under collapsed buildings and volunteers made rescue attempts. At least 40 fatalities occurred in the village. Economic losses from the earthquake could reach up to 9 percent of Morocco's GDP, according to the USGS. At least 585 schools were damaged, seven teachers died and 39 others were injured.\nSome homes in older parts of Marrakesh and portions of the city walls collapsed, leaving families trapped beneath debris. At Jemaa el-Fnaa, a minaret of the Kharboush Mosque and parts of its walls collapsed, crushing vehicles below. The Kutubiyya Mosque was also damaged. Several buildings in the Medina of Marrakesh, a UNESCO World Heritage Site dating from the 12th century, also collapsed. Internet access was disrupted due to power cuts. The historic 12th-century Tinmel Mosque was extensively destroyed; a tower partially collapsed and walls fell. In Tinmel village, 15 people were killed.\nThe Interior Ministry said the majority of damage occurred away from cities and towns. Near the epicentre in the High Atlas, public television channel Al Aoula reported many buildings collapsed. Entire villages near the epicentre were levelled. At the earthquake's epicentre in the town of Al-Haouz, a collapsed house trapped its residents under rubble. At Amizmiz, a village near the epicentre, rescuers used their hands to sort through debris. Severe damage was reported throughout most of the town, and up to 2,000 people were feared to have died there. Nearly all of the 50 traditional houses in the village of Majat were destroyed and dozens of its inhabitants were killed. Ninety-percent of houses in Asni were destroyed. In the village of Anerni, 36 people died. Additional homes in towns near the epicentre collapsed partly or completely. Electricity and roads were also cut in some areas. In Essaouira, parts of facades fell off.\nThe towns of Tafeghaghte, Adassil and Imlil, as well as nearby villages surrounding Mount Toubkal were destroyed or severely damaged. An estimated 200 homes were destroyed in Ijoukak alone and between 80 and 100 residents, around half of its population, were killed. In Tafeghaghte, a village of 200 residents, 90 died and many remained missing. The village of Ighil, near the epicenter, was also severely damaged, however only one injury occurred, as nearly all of the village's residents were attending an outdoor wedding at the time of the earthquake. In Adassil, 32 students from the same school were killed. Outside Agadir, in the villages of Taqi and Tadrart, many homes were destroyed. At least 70 people died in the village of Imi N'Tala. In the city of Taroudant, over 400 people were killed. Several old or historic districts in the city were badly damaged. Isolated villages in the Ouirgane Valley still had no electrical and telecommunication services two days after the earthquake, while more than 30 people died in the main village. In the village of Douzrou, roughly 100 residents died. The condition in Tinzert was described as \"one giant pile of rubble\"; at least 22 deaths occurred. Moroccan television reported that more than \"18,000 families\" had been affected in Al-Haouz alone. Some residents accused authorities of preventing them from renovating their houses, which were predominantly built with mud bricks, with cement, in order to preserve their historic value and attract tourists.\nPeople in Marrakesh removed rubble by hand while awaiting heavy equipment. Many residents remained outdoors for fear of another earthquake. Posts on social media showed people evacuating a shopping centre, restaurants and apartment buildings. Residents of the city spent the first three nights outdoors; filling up roundabouts, car parks and a public square. Some businesses in the city reopened on 10 September as King Mohammed VI recommended commercial operations to continue. Unsafe portions of the city were sealed off by officials while tourists and locals continued to move about. In the capital, Rabat, 350km (220mi) north of the epicentre, and at Imsouane, a coastal town, residents left their homes.\nThe General Secretary of the Directorate General of Internal Affairs said officials and security teams assembled resources to supply aid and assess damage. The Moroccan army cleared one of the main roads to the worst-affected areas, allowing vital assistance to reach people. In Sal\u00e9, trucks carried blankets, camp beds and lighting devices to the affected areas. Semi-trailers also carried supplies to reach these areas. Local channel 2M shared videos of emergency vehicles travelling along a dirt road. Rescue missions were disrupted as the roads through the mountainous region were congested with vehicles and fallen rocks. Collapsed buildings made from traditional mud brick, stone and rough wood complicated lowered the chances of survival as these materials disintegrated and amalgamated. The amalgamated rubble left limited air pockets for those trapped. In Al-Haouz Province, rocks were removed from roads to enable ambulances and aid to reach the affected areas. A highway in the Atlas Mountains, congested with ambulances, taxis and Red Cross members, was used to treat the injured; the severely wounded were transported to a hospital in Marrakesh. In remote areas that were difficult to access, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces used helicopters to supply basic needs. The Moroccan Health Ministry mobilized more than 2,000 doctors and nurses to respond to the earthquake.\nThere was a surge in wounded people admitted to hospitals in Marrakesh. Injured people from outside Marrakesh also began to trickle into the city to get treatment. An appeal was made to the city's residents for blood donations. On the morning of 9 September, roughly 200 people, including tourists, visited a hospital to donate blood. Among those who donated were the Moroccan national football team. The initiative amassed 6,000 bags of blood within a day of the campaign launch. Damage assessments in Marrakesh revealed most of the city was relatively undamaged.\nKing Mohammed VI, who was reportedly in France at the time of the earthquake, authorised the deployment of the Royal Moroccan Army in various affected cities in order to help. He also declared three days of national mourning and ordered the creation of a relief commission to provide survivors with aid, and the opening of special bank accounts to allow donations. Following a meeting with the King on 11 September, Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch, in his first remarks on the disaster, said that the government was committed to funding rebuilding and compensating those affected. King Mohammed VI also visited the Marrakesh University Hospital on 12 September, with state media saying that he met with earthquake victims and donated blood.\nThe Army set up a field hospital in Moulay Brahim. Rescue personnel used heavy equipment to recover survivors and bodies from debris. Survivors from the village began digging graves on a hill to bury the dead. A large tent was set-up in the village to house the homeless. Operations at Marrakesh Airport remained normal but two Ryanair flights from Marrakesh to Brussels and Beauvais, France, that were scheduled for 9 September were cancelled. British Airways replaced its regular aircraft to Marrakesh with a larger one to carry British nationals requesting repatriation.\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, Jordan, Japan, South Korea, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Algeria, Argentina, France, Germany, Iran, Israel, the Philippines, Portugal, Pakistan, Romania, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Oman, Turkey, Kuwait, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations offered to provide assistance and support to Morocco. The Netherlands released \u20ac5million in emergency aid, while the Red Cross Society of China gave the Moroccan Red Crescent $200,000 for emergency humanitarian assistance. The European Commission pledged 1 million euros ($1.07million) to support relief efforts. Aerospace company Boeing announced a $300,000-donation to the American Red Cross and CARE International. Other world leaders and heads of states offered condolences.\nThe 18-hour delay for King Mohammed VI to make an official announcement on the earthquake received criticism socially. There was also criticism of the government's delay in making an official request for assistance and that more external aid was not allowed. Frustration also grew among international aid groups on standby as they had not received formal requests. The Moroccan government did not formally ask for foreign assistance; however, they accepted aid from Qatar, Spain, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Officials said they have only approved the offer of four countries because \"a lack of coordination could be counterproductive\". They added that other offers may be approved when there is a need. On 17 September, the king sent formal messages to representatives of the four countries' search and rescue teams, thanking them for their assistance.\nBeno\u00eet Payan, the mayor of Marrakesh's sister city Marseille, France, announced that he was sending firefighters to Morocco to help with rescue operations. The President of the Regional Council of \u00cele-de-France Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse sent $535,000 in aid. The French Embassy in Morocco[fr] opened a crisis unit hotline. A rescue crew was sent from Nice, while communities across the country offered more than 2 million euros ($2.1million) in aid. The French government released 5 million euros ($5.4million) in aid for NGOs operating in Morocco. Arnaud Fraisse, head of Secouristes Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Rescuers Without Borders), said its teams were prevented by Moroccan authorities from entering the country on 10 September. On 10 September, Minister for Digital Affairs Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said that all French mobile phone operators had begun offering free calls and text messages to Morocco. In Belgium, a public memorial service for the victims of the earthquake was held in the city centre of Antwerp on 12 September, during which the Moroccan national anthem was played and a minute of silence for the dead was conducted. A six-man rescue team and four rescue dogs from De Rips in the Netherlands flew from Brussels to help in the search and rescue operations at the request of local residents. The town of Hilversum donated \u20ac20,000 to the victims. The Dutch Red Cross also launched a relief drive called Giro 6868 to help the victims, with about \u20ac3.8million worth of aid being received. Norway, through the country's red cross, pledged NOK 10 million in aid to the victims.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and King Abdullah II of Jordan ordered their governments to send aid to Morocco, while the United Arab Emirates's president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ordered the establishment of an air bridge to transport relief aid and other support, as did Saudi Arabia. Sultan Haitham bin Tarik of Oman ordered rescue teams and medical aid to be sent to Morocco on 10 September. On 12 September, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the earthquake and those of Storm Daniel in Libya on 10 and 11 September.\nAlgeria, for the first time since 2021, opened its airspace to Morocco to facilitate the arrival of humanitarian aid. The following day, Algeria proposed an 80-member specialised civil protection intervention team. Spain placed its Military Emergencies Unit, its other aid agencies, and its embassy in Rabat at Morocco's disposal. Two Spanish Air Force aircraft carrying 86 soldiers and eight search dogs were flown to Marrakesh after the Moroccan government made a bilateral appeal. The Czech Republic announced it was ready to send about 70 members of a rescue team, including nine doctors, after receiving an official request from the Moroccan government. Czech Defense Minister Jana \u010cernochov\u00e1 said three military planes were prepared to transport the team.\nThe International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research on behalf of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to provide humanitarian satellite coverage. On 9 September, a team of 50 paramedics and personnel from Tunisia arrived. The team also brought search dogs, thermal imaging devices, a drone, and field hospital. A Qatari rescue team arrived in Morocco on 11 September. By 6 October, the Moroccan Red Crescent had supported over 50,000 people. They deployed over 290 volunteers across the affected provinces to assist in search and rescue efforts, preparing medical caravans and makeshift medical tents.\nThe Confederation of African Football postponed the qualifying match for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations between Morocco and Liberia, which was due to be held in Agadir on 9 September. The qualifying match between the Republic of the Congo and The Gambia went ahead as scheduled in Marrakesh on 10 September. UEFA announced a moment of silence for the victims for all club and national team matches until 21 September.\nUNESCO experts visited the Medina of Marrakesh on 9 September to take a first look at the damage. The organization said it would provide support according to the needs expressed, with Director General Audrey Azoulay specifying \"whether it is a matter of surveying the damage in the fields of heritage and education, making buildings safe or preparing for reconstruction\".\nOn 14 September, the monarchy announced that 50,000 houses had been damaged by the earthquake, and pledged shelter and 30,000 dirhams ($3,000) to affected households, as well as reconstruction aid of 140,000 dirhams for collapsed homes and 80,000 for damaged ones. The King also designated all children orphaned by the earthquake as \"Wards of the Nation\".\nThe Red Cross announced the recovery process could take years; several villages near the epicentre in the remote mountainous region were completely flattened and/or inaccessible, with the paucity of infrastructure such railways, roads, and hospitals vis-\u00e0-vis the north of the country hampering relief efforts.\nOn 20 September, a five-year-long rehousing plan estimated at US$11.7 billion was announced after a discussion with King Mohammed VI, army and government personnel. The project aims to target 4.2 million people affected in the provinces of Al-Haouz, Chichaoua, Taroudant, Marrakech, Ouarzazate and Azilal. Besides rehousing, the project also aims to promote social and economic growth in the region through improved infrastructure. The government's budget, international assistance and a reserve scheme would supply the funds needed for the project. The country promised to provide aid of US$14,000 and $8,000 for collapsed and damaged homes, respectively. Compensation of US$38,000 and $21,000 would be provided for totally destroyed and partially destroyed homes, respectively. The government would also provide monthly support over a year of US$244 to affected families. By January 2024, the government said that around 57,600 families had received the monthly support and more than 44,000 households received reconstruction aid.\nDuring the International Monetary Fund\u2013World Bank Meetings held in Marrakesh, Morocco and Spain agreed on lending \u20ac11.6 million to support the reconstruction campaign. The United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office also added it would provide \u00a31.45 million to address the immediate needs and long-term recovery. Financial assistance would target healthcare, shelter and the local agriculture industry.\nOffers of assistance flooded in from countries and organisations including the United States, France, Turkey, the European Commission, the African Union, the International Monetary Fund, and Algeria, which maintains tumultuous relations with Morocco. Morocco has so far delayed accepting much foreign aid. Only four countries\u2014Spain, the United Kingdom, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014have seen their offers of support officially accepted by Morocco. The president of the NGO Secouristes sans fronti\u00e8res, Arnaud Fraisse, stated, \"We do not understand this situation of blocking on the part of the Moroccan government. There is no explanation at the moment.\" The Lebanese newspaper L'Orient-Le Jour declared Morocco, \"despite being wounded, is snubbing international aid,\" forcing local officials to organise assistance.\nOn the evening of 11 September, Algeria prepared three planes equipped with all the necessary medication and food supplies, along with a team of 93 rescuers. This came after Justice Minister Abdellatif Ouahbi's statement on television affirming that Algeria's aid was favorable and that coordination with the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs was required. Shortly after, the Moroccan press criticised Ouahbi's behavior, prompting him to clarify a few hours later that his statements had been misunderstood and misinterpreted. The aid was refused as Morocco informed the Algerian Consul in Casablanca that they did not need the proposed assistance. In contrast, Israeli NGOs began providing aid upon arrival in Morocco even without official approval from the Moroccan or Israeli governments.\nOn 14 September, a scheduled German Red Cross flight from Leipzig to Morocco was suddenly suspended just before takeoff. In a statement, the organization said: \"for reasons beyond our control and that of our partners in the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement.\" The flight carrying aid, tents and mats was requested by the Moroccan Red Crescent.\nIn response to these observations, the Moroccan Interior Ministry said on 10 September that its selective acceptance of aid was \"based on a precise assessment of needs on the ground\" but not an outright rejection of such offers.\nThe Spanish newspaper El Mundo criticised the delayed reaction of King Mohammed VI as he remained \"silent for hours after the drama\". The newspaper on the other hand quoted the French ambassador in Morocco, Christophe Lecourtier[fr], who justified the delay by stating that \"the Moroccan authorities were conducting an evaluation of the situation\", since \"the southern region was isolated and far from urban centres\". This statement was echoed by spokesperson of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Anne-Claire Legendre[fr], who added that \"the needs must be established prior to making a request for help\".\nAnother Spanish daily, El Pa\u00eds, found the king's \"silence\" in the face of the tragedy \"disturbing.\" L'Humanit\u00e9 expressed concern over the \"dangerous inertia of Moroccan power\". Having been in Paris since 1 September for medical reasons, King Mohammed VI returned to Rabat on 9 September, where images showed him in a working meeting.\nOn 25 October 2023, hundreds of people took to the streets of Amizmiz, one of the worst-hit towns, to protest against local and regional authorities over delays in the delivery of emergency aid and cash support for the affected families. The protests, arranged by the Amizmiz Earthquake Victims\u2019 Coordination, came after a worker's strike and repeated storms that had further worsened living conditions for the residents. After a meeting with local officials, the organization called off the demonstration, but many people still went ahead with the protests. Many families had also not received cash support which was promised by the government despite providing their contact details. They were also concerned about housing as winter was approaching. In January 2024, protests were held in Talat N'Yaaqoub and in Taroudant Province over delays in the delivery of financial relief.",

        "title": "Storm Daniel",
        "text": "Storm Daniel, also known as Cyclone Daniel, was the deadliest Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone in recorded history, as well as one of the costliest tropical cyclones on record outside of the north Atlantic Ocean. Forming as a low-pressure system around 4September 2023, the storm affected Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey with extensive flooding. The storm then organized as a Mediterranean low and was designated as Storm Daniel. It soon acquired quasi-tropical characteristics and moved toward the coast of Libya, where it caused catastrophic flooding before degenerating into a remnant low. The storm was the result of an omega block; a high-pressure zone sandwiched between two zones of low pressure, with the isobars shaping like the Greek letter omega (\u03a9).\nIn Greece, severe rainfall led to flooding that caused more than two billion euros in damage, making it the most costly recorded storm for the country. Libya was hit the hardest, with torrential rains causing two dams near the city of Derna to fail. This resulted in more than four thousand deaths, with between 10,000 and 100,000 people missing, although exact figures varied by source. Libya's vulnerability to such disasters was blamed on its civil war, which damaged critical infrastructure and left it in poor condition before the storm. In the aftermath, several countries along the Mediterranean Sea pledged to provide aid to affected countries.\nAn area of low pressure developed over the Ionian Sea with its surface temperature within the range of tropical transition. On 4September 2023, it moved inland over the Balkan Peninsula which led to torrential rains, notably over the Thessaly region. The system became a Mediterranean cyclone the following day, and was named Storm Daniel by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service. Daniel transitioned into a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone on 9 September. During the following days, the system moved southeastward, peaking as a tropical storm with winds recorded by instruments on Metop at 45 knots (83km/h; 52mph).\nThe storm made landfall near the city of Benghazi in Libya on 10September. Daniel went east and continued inland before degenerating into a low pressure-area later on, with the storm dissipating by 12 September. Climate warming may also have influenced mid-latitude atmospheric blocking in the summer, which resulted in Storm Daniel and another cold-core low that caused flooding in Spain.\nStorm Daniel was regarded by researchers from Yale University as the deadliest to hit Africa in recorded history, with its death toll surpassing flooding in Algeria that killed 3,000 in 1927. It was also regarded as the deadliest storm globally since at least Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and possibly Cyclone Nargis in 2008.\nOn 5 September, flooding in Thessaly, Greece, killed at least one person. On the same day, the village of Zagora received 1,092 millimetres (43.0in) of rain, 55 times more than the country's average rainfall for the same month. Portaria also recorded a new rainfall record of 884mm (34.8in). Further rainfall could not be measured because the weather station subsequently failed. On 6September, the Krafsidonas river, which rises at Pelion, overflowed its banks in Volos and destroyed a bridge and a nursing home, while dragging cars, buses, trees, and other debris along its path.\nOn 7 September, the main motorway between Athens and Thessaloniki was closed and train services between the two cities were suspended. In Thessaly, over 800 people had to be rescued amidst collapsed buildings and bridges and submerged villages. In Larissa, after the rains ended on 8September, water continued to rise as the Pineios river overflowed its banks to reach a level of 9.5 metres (31ft), compared to the normal level of 4m (13ft). In the Vale of Tempe, the water level rose to about 18m (59ft) meters, reaching the level of a suspension bridge.\nOne man died in Volos when a wall collapsed on him, and in the nearby Pelion area the body of an old lady was discovered on 6 September while four people were reported missing. At least six villages in and around the Pelion mountain range suffered huge damage.\nSince the rainfall started, the Copernicus Programme's Rapid Mapping Service was activated for the flood zone in Greece, in which analysis of the Sentinel-1 data from 7September revealed an estimated flood area of around 73,000 hectares (180,000 acres). Meteorologists classified the storm as Greece's worst since records began in 1930. The floods in Thessaly, which supplies about 15% of Greece's agricultural production, destroyed the crops for the remainder of the year and caused serious long-term damage as the thick layer of mud made the soil infertile, taking up to five years to become fully functional again. The governor of Thessaly, Kostas Agorastos, told the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) that the storm damage in the region was calculated to be more than \u20ac2 billion. By 16 September, the death toll in the country had risen to seventeen. Among those killed were an Austrian couple who were trapped in a holiday home that was washed away by floods in Potistika, near Pelion, on 6 September.\nPolice banned travel to Volos, certain Pelion villages and the nearby island of Skiathos. Authorities also sent text alerts to inhabitants in other areas of central Greece, on the Sporades islands and on the island of Evia near Athens, warning them to limit their movements outdoors, since flooding was forecast to continue until at least the afternoon of 7 September.\nLater that month, the Deputy Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, Evangelos Tournas, reported to the Hellenic Parliament that 110,000 animals were found dead and 135,000 poultry were registered as lost across Thessaly.\nDuring the initial days of the storm, five people were killed in Turkey during floods in \u0130\u011fneada, K\u0131rklareli Province. The deaths happened in the vicinity of \u0130\u011fneada Floodplain Forests National Park in an unlicensed bungalow establishment. Rising waters carried logs from a nearby forestry business and the logs dragged the houses along with them, destroying the buildings and killing the people in the process.\nOn 6 September, the districts of Ikitelli, Arnavutk\u00f6y, Ba\u015fak\u015fehir and K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece in Istanbul were flooded due to heavy rainfall. Two died in Ba\u015fak\u015fehir and K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece, with 31 others injured. The victims were a Guinean citizen who was trapped inside his basement apartment in K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece, the other was a woman who died after being swept away by the floods in K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece. More than 1,750 homes and businesses in the city were affected. The governor of Istanbul, Davut G\u00fcl, said the city received rainfall roughly equivalent to what it would expect in the entirety of September in the space of six hours. He also said on social media that authorities would provide accommodation and safety for those affected by flooding.\nVillages on and near the Black Sea coast in Burgas Province, including Kosti and Arapya, became submerged, forcing evacuations. Three people were swept away after a bridge collapsed in the Tsarevo area, and another person drowned near the town.\nRainfall in Kosti was measured at 311 millimetres (12.2in) (420% of the monthly average for September), in Ahtopol it amounted to 196 millimetres (7.7in) (350% of the monthly average), and in Gramatikovo to 275 millimetres (10.8in) (368% of the monthly average). In Tsarevo, rainfall was expected to set a national record, with 330 millimetres (13in) of precipitation within 20 hours (40% of the annual average). Flooding in the town prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency.\nA rare waterspout of approximately 80 metres (260ft) was observed in the sea near Tyulenovo in the northeast of the country.\nThe whole southern region of Bulgaria\u2019s Black Sea coast was affected by the disaster. Most of the rivers in the region burst their banks and several bridges were destroyed, causing serious transporting and rescue problems to over 4,000 inhabitants and tourists, according to tourism minister Zaritsa Dinkova.\nOsama Hamada, Prime Minister of the Government of National Stability which controls eastern Libya, declared a state of emergency on 9 September and suspended classes as a precaution. The National Oil Corporation also announced a three-day closure of four oil ports including Ras Lanuf, Zueitina, Brega, and Sidra. The facilities in Ras Lanuf, Brega, and Sidra reopened on 12 September, while the port of Zueitina reopened on 13 September.\nIn Libya, at least 4,333 people were killed, mostly in and around the city of Derna after the Derna (also known as Belad) and Mansour (or Abu Mansour) dams collapsed, releasing an estimated 30 million cubic metres (39 million cubic yards) of water, and causing catastrophic damage across the area after the Wadi Derna overflowed its banks by 50 metres (160ft) on each side. 30,000 residents were displaced.\nPrior to the storm, residents were prevented from leaving their homes after authorities imposed a precautionary curfew at 10:00 PM on 10 September. Residents recalled hearing loud explosions at the time the dams burst, with video showing the flood reaching Derna shortly before 03:00EET on 11 September. Prime Minister Hamada stated that residential neighborhoods were swept away. Videos posted to social media showed cars being submerged in the deluge. Four bridges also collapsed, while Hamada's aviation minister Hisham Chkiouat said that Derna looked as if it had been hit by a \"tsunami\". He also said that 25% of the city had \"disappeared\", with large parts of the city dragged out to the Mediterranean Sea.\nHamada's health minister, Othman Abduljalil, said 6,000 people were missing in Derna alone. The mayor of Derna, Abdulmenam Al-Ghaithi, told al-Arabiya that the final death toll in the city could range from 18,000 to 20,000, equivalent to a fifth of the city's population. Only three of the city's ten districts escaped the flooding, while five out of seven entry routes into Derna were rendered inaccessible. The collapse of bridges along the Wadi Derna effectively split the city into two. Officials said that of the 6,142 buildings in Derna, a total of 1,500 suffered damage, of which 891 were completely destroyed, 211 partially destroyed, and the remaining 398 were submerged in mud. An estimated six square-kilometres (2.3-square-mile) of land in the city was inundated.\nHospitals in the city were rendered inoperable while morgues filled up, prompting bodies to be laid out on sidewalks and in the city's main square. More than 300 bodies were sent to a morgue in Tobruk to cope with the overcrowding. More than 1,000 bodies were later buried in mass graves. Naval teams were dispatched to recover bodies swept out to sea by the floods. Over the succeeding days, at least 200 bodies were found washed up as far as 20 kilometers from Derna. Others were found more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the city. Dozens of victims were found trapped in their cars at sea. One survivor was rescued after being found 11 nautical miles (about ~20 kilometers) off the coast of Derna.\nThe scale of the disaster in Derna was attributed to decades of neglect of the region by the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, followed by the city becoming a battleground during the civil war and concurrent NATO intervention in the 2010s and its resulting political effects that included the establishment of rival governments in the west and east of the country respectively. After Gaddafi's overthrow, the city changed hands four times. The collapsed dams were built by Yugoslav company Hidrotehnika-Hidroenergetika from 1973 to 1977 to control flooding, irrigate agricultural lands and provide water to nearby communities. They were described as clay-filled embankment dams with a height of 75 meters and 45 meters respectively.\nThe Mansour (or Abu Mansour) dam had a water storage capacity of 1.5 million cubic meters, while the Derna (or Belad) dam upstream had a capacity of 22.5 million cubic meters (1.5 million cubic meters by another source).\nThe two dams sustained major damage in a storm in 1986, and cracks were reported in both structures in 1998. Derna's deputy mayor said that the dams had not been maintained since 2002 and were not built to withstand such volumes of water. The lack of maintenance occurred despite the allocation of more than 2 million euros for that purpose in 2012 and 2013. However, a Turkish construction firm called Arsel Construction Company Limited claimed that it had been contracted to do maintenance work on the dam and build another one in 2007, saying that it had completed its tasks in 2012. Libyan officials repudiated the claims, saying that the company stopped work following the outbreak of the civil war in 2011.\nAs recently as 2022, a researcher at the Omar Al-Mukhtar University in Bayda, Libya, had warned in a paper that the dams needed urgent attention, pointing out that there was \"a high potential for flood risk\". The paper also called officials to urgently carry out maintenance on the dams, prophetically stating that \u201c(in) a huge flood, the results will be catastrophic\u201d. The Wadi Derna had been known to be prone to flooding, having experienced four major floods between 1942 and 2011. It is believed that the collapse of the Derna dam, located at the convergence of two river valleys, led to waters rushing 12 kilometers (seven miles) towards the sea and overwhelming the Mansur dam, which was already under stress from rising water levels in its reservoir, along the way. Representatives of the Red Cross said that the dams' failure produced waves with a height of seven metres (23 feet).\nAbout 170 millimetres (6.7in) of rain fell in Al Abraq. Witnesses told Reuters that floodwaters rose as high as 3.0 metres (10ft). Flooding also occurred in Tobruk, Tacnis, Al-Bayada, Battah, Qandulah, and Mechili as well as throughout the Jabal al Akhdar district and in Misrata to the west. In Al-Wardiya, at least 20 of the village's 50 houses were washed out by the floods. At least 27 people were reported killed and many more were missing. There were 19 deaths reported in Susa, seven in the towns of Omar al-Mokhtar and Shahhat, and one in Marj. Eight people were reported to have died in Alfaydia. In Bayda, hospitals were evacuated due to significant flooding brought by Daniel. 200 people were killed, and dozens were missing. About 414 millimeters of rain fell in the city, equivalent to 77% of its average annual total. Around 5,000 homes, 35 kilometers of roads and 20 kilometers of drainage lines in the city suffered damage. In Marawa, around 60 farms were destroyed.\nDamage was also reported in archaeological sites across eastern Libya. Several structures and in situ artifacts at the ruins of Cyrene were buried in mud or swept downstream into the Mansura region. The floods also revealed previously unexcavated portions and artifacts at the site. The International Crisis Group warned that the site was at risk of collapse, citing the erosion of the site's outer walls and drainage channels and contaminated wastewater flowing through the ruins. Damage was also reported in the archaeological sites of Apollonia and Athrun, with some artifacts reportedly washed out to sea.\nThe disaster was seen as the worst to hit the Cyrenaica region since the 1963 Marj earthquake. Conflicting figures emerged regarding the number of casualties. As of 26 September 2023, at least 4,199 people are known to have died from the storm in Libya according to Libyan authorities, with at least 170 deaths reported outside Derna, while Libyan authorities say between 10,000 and 100,000 others are missing, including seven members of the Libyan National Army. Prior to that, it was initially reported that more than 11,000 people had died according the United Nations, which in turn based its figures from the Libyan Red Crescent. However, the latter agency rejected the claims, saying that official numbers were released by Libyan authorities. About 7,000 people were reportedly injured and 46,000 were displaced, including more than 16,000 children. 117 schools were also affected, with four schools being totally destroyed and 80 others suffering partial damage. Ten hospitals and 20 other medical facilities were forced out of service by the storm. Three volunteers of the Libyan Red Crescent were killed while responding to the floods. Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the de facto ruler of eastern Libya, called the damage \"huge\" and \"hard to describe or measure\".\nThe Libyan Football Federation confirmed the deaths of four players in its leagues, namely Shaheen Al-Jamil, a member of Premier League club Al Tahaddi based in Benghazi, Monder Sadaqa, from Premier-League club Darnes based in Derna, and brothers Saleh and Ayoub Sasi, who were members of Darnes' youth team. A fifth player, Ibrahim Al-Qaziri of Second Division club Nusour Martouba, was also reported by the BBC to have been killed. Derna Stadium also suffered severe damage from the floods.\nMore than 400 foreign nationals were killed during the floods, including at least 276 migrants from Sudan, A member of the Sudanese community in Derna said that 700 Sudanese families in the city had been displaced by the floods. 145 Egyptian citizens, seventy-five of whom were from the village of Al-Sharif in Beni Suef, and 23 Palestinians. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated that at least 42 Syrians also died in the storm, adding that the total number of deaths could reach 150.\nThe World Meteorological Organization said that the casualties caused by the floods could have been prevented had a functional weather service been in place in Libya, adding that its attempts to help Libyan authorities in that effort had been hampered by the prevailing security situation. The United Nations' aid chief Martin Griffiths said on 14 September that an estimated 884,000 people in the country were in need of assistance, while almost 300,000 children were at risk of exposure to post-flood diseases, violence and exploitation.\nThe Libyan Post Telecommunications and Information Technology Company said that the storm cut off the submarine internet cable linking Libya to Europe, \"completely\" destroying the country's international communications gateway. Libya's Roads and Bridges Authority assessed that 70% of civilian infrastructure in the affected areas was destroyed by the storm, with 80% of the water system going out of service and 50% of all roads impassable, while a total of 11 bridges collapsed.\nDaniel reached Egypt on 11 September, where parts of the northwestern region of the country experienced moderate rainfall.\nAs Daniel's remnants reached the Nile Delta and Cairo, residents across the country reported an unusual odor on 12 September. Manar Ghanem, a representative from the media center of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority, refuted any connection between the phenomenon and Daniel, but noted that the storm had caused dust, rain and weather fluctuations.\nThe remnants of Daniel reached Israel on 13 September, causing unusually heavy localized rains. Minor property damage and a number of sinkholes were reported but without injuries.\nThe Libyan Presidential Council based in Tripoli declared the cities of Derna, Shahhat, and Bayda disaster zones, while the Tripoli-based Health Ministry dispatched a plane carrying 14 tons of medical equipment, drugs, body bags, and personnel to Benghazi on 12 September. The House of Representatives (HoR) based in Benghazi, which controls most of the areas affected, declared three days of national mourning, as did the internationally recognized Government of National Unity (GNU) based in Tripoli led by Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah. Dbeibah pledged an investigation over the extensive damage, as well as the allotment of 2.5 billion Libyan dinars ($515 million) to help rebuild Derna and Benghazi, while the House of Representatives unveiled a nearly $2-billion budget for relief efforts. Dbeibah also announced the establishment of a meticulous evaluation process for foreign aid, saying that they would \"only accept aid that is deemed necessary.\"\nOn 14 September, Dbeibah took responsibility for the collapse of the dam and the failure to enact its maintenance. On 15 September, Libyan General Prosecutor al-Sediq al-Sour (HoR) announced that he would open an investigation into the disaster in Derna. Abdulmenam Al-Ghaithi was suspended from his post as mayor of Derna, while the entire city council was dismissed and subjected to investigation on orders of Prime Minister Hamada. Serour later ordered the arrest of Ghaithi, two members of the Derna city council and 17 officials responsible for water resources and dam management on suspicion of \"bad management\" and negligence.\nTelevision channels across the country carried a joint broadcast for the first time to collect donations. Ordinary Libyans also responded to calls for help on social media, with individuals as far away as Zawiya, in GNU-controlled territory west of Tripoli, volunteering to go to Derna to assist in relief efforts.\nThe United Nations noted that the rival governments had been coordinating with each other regarding the relief efforts. On 13 September, a GNU ministerial delegation left Tripoli to assess the damage in Derna. At the same time, reports emerged of the Libyan National Army \u2013 commanded by Khalifa Haftar \u2013 preventing journalists from entering the city and confiscating their phones. Haftar himself promised promotions to soldiers who participated in the relief efforts. The first relief convoys arrived in Derna late on 12 September. On 14 September, the port of Derna was reopened to vessels with a minimum draft level of 6.5 meters delivering humanitarian aid, while electricity was restored to the western part of the city. On the same day, the Libyan Ambulance and Emergency Service announced that remaining residents of Derna were to be evacuated and the city closed except for search-and-rescue teams. On 18 September, the GNU announced the beginning of construction of a temporary bridge across the Wadi Derna. The HoR-led administration announced that an international conference would be held in Derna on 1\u20132 November to discuss plans for its reconstruction. It also announced the establishment of a fund for the reconstruction of Derna and a compensation scheme for those displaced, with residents whose homes were destroyed receiving 100,000 dinars ($20,500), those with partially destroyed homes receiving 50,000 dinars, and those who lost furniture or household appliances receiving 20,000 dinars.\nOn 13 September, evacuations were advised by authorities for the town of Tocra, west of Derna, after they warned that a dam in the area was at risk of collapse.\nThe Libyan disease control agency reported on 15 September that at least 150 people had contracted diarrhea in Derna after drinking contaminated water, prompting the agency to ban affected residents from utilizing local water sources. Authorities subsequently divided Derna into four sections to create buffers in case of a disease outbreak. The HoR's Health Ministry announced the beginning of a vaccination campaign in Derna prioritizing children, rescue workers, and medical personnel. On 19 September, nearly 60 local recovery workers were hospitalized due to diarrhea and vomiting.\nOn 17 September, a bus carrying a Greek humanitarian aid team to Derna collided with a car carrying a Libyan family east of Benghazi. Three Hellenic Army personnel and two Greek Foreign Ministry translators in the bus, and three passengers of the other car were killed. Two other occupants of the car and eight bus passengers were injured.\nOn 18 September, residents of Derna protested outside the city\u2019s Al Sahaba Mosque and denounced the HoR and its speaker, Aguila Saleh. Some of the demonstrators later set fire to Mayor Ghaithi's residence. The protesters also called for the downfall of the HoR, the establishment of a United Nations office in the city, and an investigation of the city council and past budgets. In response, the Government of National Stability ordered the expulsion of all journalists from Derna for allegedly hampering rescue efforts and prevented a United Nations team from entering the city. Internet and telephone access was cut for 36 hours, which the state telecommunications company said was caused by the severing of fiber-optic cables due to possible sabotage. Around a dozen people were arrested, according to Libyan National Army officials.\nTunisia, Germany, Qatar, Iran, Malta, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates pledged humanitarian assistance to Libya, while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said that he would deploy the country's military in coordination with eastern Libyan forces to help in relief operations. He also declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the floods as well as those of the 2023 Moroccan earthquake on 8 September. A military delegation led by armed forces chief of staff Osama Askar went to eastern Libya on 12 September to meet with Khalifa Haftar. The delegation included 25 rescue teams and three military aircraft carrying humanitarian supplies. The bodies of 84 Egyptians who were killed in Derna were repatriated from Tobruk and buried on 13 September. Following a request from the president of the Libyan Presidential Council, Mohamed al-Menfi, Algeria sent eight Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft carrying humanitarian aid that included food supplies, medical equipment, clothing, and tents.\nOn 12 September, Italy activated its civil protection departments, with Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani stating an assessment team was on their way, with the naval vessel San Marco arriving in the port of Derna on 16 September carrying two search and rescue helicopters, 100 tents, 5,000 blankets, sanitary equipment, eight water pumps and engineering equipment. The Italian government extended its state of \u201cintervention for overseas emergency\u201d for six months and allocated five million euros to support relief operations in eastern Libya. Anne-Claire Legendre, a spokesperson for France's foreign ministry, announced that the country was ready to respond to requests made by Libya's government. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the organization was on stand-by to bring support, while the commission's president Ursula von der Leyen expressed condolences. Member states Germany, Romania and Finland subsequently sent aid. The World Health Organization sent a shipment consisting of 40 tons of aid to Libya. The United Nations allocated $10 million for disaster relief. The European Union also pledged to provide \u20ac2 billion to Greece in the aftermath of the natural disasters, expected to be used for reconstruction efforts and restoration of the affected areas.\nLibyan club Al-Ahly Benghazi asked the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to postpone its upcoming African Champions League match scheduled on 17 September against Ivoirian side ASEC Mimosas. Al-Hilal Benghazi also asked the CAF to postpone its upcoming African Confederation Cup match scheduled on 15 September against Rwandan side Rayon Sport, citing the \"unsuitable\" situation created by the floods. The CAF subsequently moved Al-Ahly's match to 18 September and that of Al-Hilal to 23 September. It also announced a moment of silence for the victims of the storm, as well as that of the 2023 Moroccan earthquake for succeeding matches.\nThe disruption of oil exports from Libya due to the storm contributed to the price of Brent crude rising to $92.38 per barrel on 12 September, the highest price recorded since November 2022.\nIn Greece, the effects of Storm Daniel, combined with the country's worst wildfires earlier in the summer, prompted Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to pledge a 10 percent rebate on property tax for homeowners insuring their property against natural disasters and consider making calamity insurance compulsory.\nIn the week following the storm, more than 120 boats carrying around 7,000 migrants and refugees from Africa arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa within 24 hours, increasing the volume handled by the local migration reception center by 15 times and leading to the migrants outnumbering the island's native population. The increase was partly attributed to Storm Daniel, as people-smugglers paused operations for several days during its onslaught, thus creating a bottleneck for those stuck in North African countries such as Tunisia.\nOther disasters which occurred around the same time as Daniel:",

        "text": "Four large earthquakes measuring Mww 6.3 each and their aftershocks affected Herat Province in western Afghanistan in early October 2023. The first two earthquakes occurred on 7 October at 11:11 AFT and 11:42 AFT near the city of Herat, followed by many aftershocks. On 11 and 15 October, two other magnitude 6.3 earthquakes struck the same area. Thrust faulting was associated with these earthquakes. The World Health Organization estimated 1,482 fatalities, 2,100 injuries, 43,400  people affected and 114,000 people requiring humanitarian aid. The 11, 15 and 28 October earthquakes caused a combined seven deaths and 344 injuries.\nThe earthquakes struck Afghanistan during an ongoing humanitarian crisis following the Taliban takeover in 2021, and existing aid groups were experiencing a lack of funds prior to the disaster. Some aid agencies including UNICEF and the Red Cross appealed for donations in response to the earthquakes. Many international organizations and countries participated in rescue and relief efforts. Hospitals were overwhelmed by the number of injured and lack of proper equipment. Additional thousands were made homeless as the country enters the winter.\nAfghanistan is situated within the broad and complex zone of collision between the Arabian Plate, the Indian Plate, and the Eurasian Plate. The western part of the country is subdivided into the North Afghan Platform to the north and a series of accreted terranes to the south. The North Afghan Platform has remained relatively tectonically stable since the Variscan Orogeny during the Late Palaeozoic, when it became part of Eurasia. To the south there is a collage of continental fragments and magmatic arcs that have been progressively accreted, particularly in the Mesozoic era. The boundary between these two crustal areas is the major right-lateral strike-slip Harirud (or Herat) Fault, which is far less seismically active than the Chaman Fault that runs through the east of the country. To the north of the Harirud Fault, the near parallel Band-e Turkestan Fault does show signs of recent activity, also in a right-lateral sense.\nThe seismicity of Afghanistan is attributed to the complex and active tectonic interactions between the Arabian, Eurasian, and Indian plates. Within 250km (160mi) of the 7 October earthquakes epicenters, there have been seven magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquakes with epicenters in Iran. These include a Mw\u202f 7.3 earthquake in May 1997 and a Mw\u202f 7.1 earthquake in 1979. In June 2022, eastern Afghanistan was affected by an earthquake that killed over 1,000 people.\nThe first event, measuring a magnitude of 6.3, struck at 11:11 AFT (06:41 UTC). A magnitude 5.5 aftershock occurred eight minutes later. Another magnitude 6.3 event struck at 11:42 AFT (07:12 UTC), followed by a magnitude 5.9 aftershock. On 11 October, a third Mww\u202f 6.3 earthquake occurred within the same area and another event of the same magnitude occurring on 15 October. While the United States Geological Survey estimated the fourth event had a magnitude of Mww\u202f6.3. The United States Geological Survey said all four earthquakes were the result of shallow thrust faulting. The fault plane solution indicate a rupture source striking east\u2013west with a north or south dip.  On October 28, a Mww\u202f5.0 event hit the area, followed by a mb\u202f4.8 aftershock the next day.\nAccording to seismologists, these earthquakes had epicenters between the Siakhubulak Fault in the north and Herat Fault in the south. According to satellite data from Sentinel-1A, an area measuring 30km (19mi) by 15km (9.3mi) and extending east\u2013west around the location of these earthquakes was uplifted. Meanwhile the satellite detected subsidence in a small area east of the uplifted zone. The seismologists added that the ground deformation was diffuse and inferred the earthquakes were associated with a blind thrust fault. The fault responsible is likely a structure located between the Herat and Siakhubulak faults.\nItaly's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology released two possible finite fault models for the second large earthquake. In both models, no slip occurred at the top depth of the model. The first model is a north-dipping, east-southeast\u2013west-northwest striking thrust fault. The rupture mechanism was reverse-faulting with a small right-lateral component, initiating at a depth of 5.0km (3.1mi). In this model, the maximum slip was 2.2m (7ft 3in) at 4.8km (3.0mi) depth and immediately east of the hypocenter. Slip of 1m (3ft 3in) or greater was observed east and west of the hypocenter although the largest slip (>2m (6ft 7in)) was observed to the east.\nIn the latter model, the fault dips to the south and strikes east\u2013west. The focal depth is inferred to be 5.8km (3.6mi); the zone of maximum slip is located east of the hypocenter, where it peaked at 2.8m (9ft 2in). Overall, to the immediate east and west of the hypocenter, the slip was about 2m (6ft 7in) although the larger values were observed further away.\nThe World Health Organization reported 1,482 deaths as of 19 October while Taliban officials said about 1,000 had died. The Taliban revised the death toll on 11 October from a previous estimate of over 3,000. They added that confusion arose as rescue groups had counted twice and there were coordination issues. The World Health Organization said 90 percent of the casualties were women and children who died in their homes when they collapsed. At the time of the earthquakes, most men were outdoors, the organization added. The World Health Organization recorded 2,100 wounded while the Taliban provided an estimate of 2,400 people injured.\nThe United Nations also estimated 43,300 people affected and 114,000 people in need of aid. Among the villages affected were Mahal Wadakah, where 20 people died, Dasht Hows, Bahadorzai, and Zoryan. Telephone communications were also lost. In addition to the destruction in Herat Province, collapsed houses and injuries were also reported in the neighbouring provinces of Badghis and Farah.\nOver 21,500 houses were destroyed, and 17,088 others were severely damaged. At least 21,300 buildings, including 21 health facilities and 21 schools also received damage. Homes constructed of mud constituted the hardest-hit settlements; a resident of one of the affected areas said many homes collapsed during the first earthquake. An official representing the National Disaster Management Authority said in several villages with populations of 1,000, only 100 out of an estimated 300 houses remained intact.\nOver 15 villages were destroyed, three others were severely damaged and 38 were moderately affected. The village of Nayeb Rafi was completely razed and nearly 80 percent of its population perished. In Siah Aab, Zinda Jan District, 300 inhabitants perished. In the Kushk District, more than 200 houses were damaged or destroyed to some extent. Entire families, including some with 30 members, were reportedly trapped under the rubble. In the village of Sarboland, dozens of houses were levelled and a resident said at least 30 people died. Up to 170 people were reported to have died in the village of Kashkak. Hundreds of people remained trapped beneath collapsed ruins, said a government official on 8 October.\nMedieval-era minarets in Herat also sustained damage. Plaster from walls fell while parts of buildings collapsed in the city. In Iran, one person in Torbat-e Jam was injured and minor damage to houses occurred in Taybad.\nThe 11 October earthquake killed three people and injured at least 169. Of the injured, 153 were in Herat, 13 were from Badghis, and three were from Farah provinces. Many people were living outdoors because of damage to homes from the first two quakes when the third earthquake struck in the early morning. The governor's office in Herat said several neighbouring districts that were badly affected by previous earthquakes had experienced \"huge losses\" following the 11 October shock. This earthquake destroyed all 700 houses in Chahak, a village undamaged by the previous earthquakes. The Herat\u2013Torghundi highway was blocked by a landslide. In Herat, damage was limited; bricks from the Akhtaruddin Castle collapsed and parts of its walls fractured. Several minarets also collapsed. Parts of rooftop of the Great Mosque of Herat fell and scattered debris into the floor; the Herat Citadel was also damaged.\nThe earthquake on 15 October caused four deaths, 160 injuries and additional damage in the eastern districts of Herat city. Several villages were completely destroyed and power outages occurred in most of Herat Province. Two people were also injured in Torbat-e Jam, Iran. The 28 October earthquake injured 13 people and caused additional property damage in Herat.\nThe earthquakes occurred at a time when the region was struggling to cope with multiple crises such as displacement caused by decades of war, a years-long drought, and a huge reduction in foreign aid since the Taliban takeover in 2021.\nThe World Health Organization dispatched 12 ambulances to Zinda Jan District to transport casualties to hospitals. The United Nations dispatched four ambulances carrying doctors and psychosocial support counsellors to a hospital. The Associated Press reported on 9 October that three mobile health teams were expected to be in Zinda Jan District. Five medical tents designed to assist 80 patients were established by Doctors Without Borders at Herat Regional Hospital. Seven teams of the Afghan Red Crescent Society were involved in rescue efforts while more teams were expected to arrive from eight other provinces. A spokesman for the organization said people made homeless were residing at a temporary shelter. The organization also provided tarpaulins, water storage containers, kitchen appliances, blankets and many other essentials. UNICEF distributed 10,000 hygiene kits, 5,000 family kits, 1,500 sets of winter clothes and blankets, 1,000 tarpaulins, and basic household items to the area.\nThe national director of World Vision Afghanistan said on 9 October that \"the situation is worse than we imagined\", adding that people were still attempting to rescue those trapped under debris with their hands. Communication outage and blocked roads hampered rescue missions. In affected villages, residents used shovels and their bare hands to retrieve survivors beneath the rubble. An Afghan police spokesperson said on 8 October that the affected people required food and shelter. Personnel from the military and nonprofit organizations such as the Red Crescent also participated in rescue missions. The World Food Program said their workers were distributing food packages. Food packages were ready for 20,000 people; each package sufficient to sustain a family of seven for a month. The organization was also preparing to provide food support for up to 70,000 people. Athlete Rashid Khan pledged his Cricket World Cup fees to help victims of the earthquake and announced that a fundraising campaign would be set up.\nA provincial health department official said over 200 bodies were transported to hospitals and many of the dead were women and children. The main hospital of Herat prepared for the large inflow of victims by lining-up beds outside. At Herat Hospital, a health worker said vans carrying bodies were arriving every minute. Many health workers at the hospital were overwhelmed at the number of injured and the morgue had been overrun. The Taliban governor's office in Kandahar said 10 teams including 37 doctors and nurses were sent to Herat Province. Kandahar's public health director said the teams were also transporting 2 tons of medicine.\nBy 10 October, approximately 72 hours after the first two earthquakes, rescue efforts had subsided; however, rescue and relief teams were active again following the third earthquake on 11 October. Health teams transferred several of the wounded to a hospital. According to the Afghan Red Crescent on 12 October, search and rescue efforts were 98 percent completed. However in the affected area, 32 health and rescue groups would remain in the area. There were no announcements from the Taliban about officially ending all rescue efforts. Following the 15 october earthquake, three damage assessment teams were dispatched by Iran to Razavi and South Khorasan provinces. Iran also sent a damage assessment team to Torbat-e Jam.\nMass funerals were held in the affected villages. Three hundred people were given a mass funeral and burial in Siah Ab. More than 35 rescue teams from military and nonprofit organizations had been deployed. On 13 October, the Supreme Court of Afghanistan ordered the release of 473 prisoners from a prison facility in Herat Province due to fears that it may collapse after cracks were found in its walls during a two-day damage inspection. All prisoners were released by the same day on compassionate grounds and because they had served most of their sentence.\nAbout 2,100 displaced people fled to Herat. People with relatives or homes in other provinces evacuated Herat after the 15 October earthquake. Due to aftershocks, many survivors did not sleep in their homes. The World Health Organization said these aftershocks had left survivors \"in a persistent state of anxiety and fear\". Many homes, offices and mosques were abandoned as residents were living in temporary tents. Many traumatized and anxious people visited hospitals for assistance. The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Herat Province became a \u201ctent city\u201d as people took refuge under tents in parks and open spaces. In January 2024, Fran Equiza, the UNICEF representative in Afghanistan, said that almost 100,000 children in the affected areas remained in urgent need of humanitarian aid.\nMany hospitals in Herat became overwhelmed by patients. At the Herat Regional Hospital, there were support teams from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Although most patients did not have life-threatening injuries, many remained at the hospital because their homes were uninhabitable. Afghanistan was also entering the winter season while thousands of people remained homeless admist cold temperatures. Doctors Without Borders stated that more than 340 people were discharged from a hospital but refused to leave as they had no homes. By 12 October, the World Health Organization had treated over 5,600 individuals; many were from Zendeh Jan District. Strong winds occurred across the country beginning on 12 October, damaging tents and injuring additional people.\nAbdul Ghani Baradar, Afghanistan's Deputy Prime Minister of Economic Affairs, visited the affected area and met locals, officials and health workers. During the visit, he also announced the Taliban would construct new houses for surviviors. The Taliban announced they plan to provide housing for survivors before the winter.\nBy January 2024, at least 3,000 houses had been constructed in Zinda Jan, while the reconstruction efforts saw the usage of superadobe housing in Afghanistan for the first time. However, Luo Dapeng, the representative of the World Health Organization in Afghanistan, estimated that between 200,000 to 300,000 people were still living in tents following the earthquake.\nThe Taliban publicly appealed for aid; at a news conference on 8 October, they said all international and internal organizations support was needed. Besides many countries offering aid, many international organizations also contributed to the humanitarian response. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said requested immediate assistance and said on 12 October, only 36 percent of its US$132.64million appeal was collected. A separate fundraising for US$20million was also organized by UNICEF. Nevertheless, the international response to the earthquake was seen as slow due to many countries' reluctance to interact with the Taliban-led government and the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas War, which began hours before the first mainshock happened on 7 October. In February 2024, the UN estimated that around $400 million was needed for reconstruction and recovery efforts from the disaster.",

        "title": "Hurricane Otis",
        "text": "Hurricane Otis was a compact but very powerful tropical cyclone which made a devastating landfall in October 2023 near Acapulco as a Category 5 hurricane. Otis was the first Pacific hurricane to make landfall at Category5 intensity and surpassed Hurricane Patricia as the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. Otis was the costliest tropical cyclone to strike Mexico on record. The fifteenth tropical storm, tenth hurricane, eighth major hurricane, and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season, Otis originated from a disturbance several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Initially forecast to stay offshore and to only be a weak tropical storm at peak intensity, Otis instead underwent explosive intensification to reach peak winds of 165mph (270km/h) and made landfall at peak intensity. Once inland, the hurricane quickly weakened before dissipating the following day.\nMaking landfall just west of Acapulco, Otis's powerful winds severely damaged many of the buildings in the city. Landslides and flooding resulted from heavy rain. Communication was heavily cut off, initially leaving information about the hurricane's impact largely unknown. In the aftermath, the city had no drinking water and many residents also lost power. The government of Guerrero mobilized thousands of military members to aid survivors and assist in recovery efforts. Thousands of recovery items were sent out to those affected and donations were sent out to each of the affected families.\nThe hurricane caused at least 52 deaths and left 32 others missing. Total damage from Otis was estimated to be billions of dollars (2023 USD), with several agencies estimating more than 10 billion USD. Coparmex estimated that repairs would cost between $11.5\u201317.2 billion ($200\u2013300 billion MXN), which would make it the costliest tropical cyclone (Atlantic or Pacific) on record for Mexico. According to Reuters, Mexican business groups estimate damage at $16 billion.\nOn October15, 2023, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that an area of low pressure was expected to form several hundred miles south of southeastern Mexico over the next seven days. This forecast came to fruition on October18 with the development of a broad low several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Accompanied by disorganized convection, organization into a tropical cyclone was deemed likely within five days as the system meandered in the same general area. Convection grew in scope the following day, though upper-level wind shear displaced this to the west of the system's center. Throughout October21, convection increase in coverage and the system's surface circulation became more defined. The disturbance's meandering motion shifted to a northward crawl as it was wedged between a ridge to the northeast and a trough to the northwest. Following further convective organization, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Eighteen-E at 15:00UTC (10:00a.m. CDT) on October22. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 530mi (850km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Six hours later, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Otis.\nLight to moderate southeasterly wind shear displaced convection northwest of Otis's surface circulation during the overnight hours of October22\u201323. The lack of vertical alignment delayed potential intensification despite an otherwise favorable environment consisting of high sea surface temperatures and abundant atmospheric moisture. Sea surface temperatures ahead of the system averaged 86\u201388\u00b0F (30\u201331\u00b0C), above average for this time of year. The high temperatures resulted from a combination of a record-warm September for Mexico, an ongoing El Ni\u00f1o, and the influence of global warming. The system's motion shifted from due north to north-northwest during this time, remaining around 4\u20135mph (6\u20138km/h). A convective band developed halfway around the storm by the afternoon of October23 and the surface circulation moved closer to thunderstorm activity. During the overnight of October23\u201324, microwave satellite imagery depicted a low-level ring structure, despite the overall sheared appearance of the system. The storm's forward motion also increased during this time, potentially offsetting the negative impacts of southeasterly wind shear. As a result, upper-level outflow expanded noticeably and the system's core became centered in the convection. This led to Otis beginning an intensification phase that would continue until landfall. As the morning of October24 progressed, outflow continued to expand in all directions atop Otis and many banding features circulated the storm. The improvement in outflow was accentuated by a powerful jet streak\u2014a wind maxima within the jet stream\u2014which accelerated the rate of latent heat dispersal and fostered convective development.\nAt 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT), the NHC upgraded Otis to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The first and only Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter mission reached Otis shortly after and found a dramatically more intense system, much stronger than suggested by the satellite imagery-based Dvorak technique, and the NHC quickly raised their intensity estimate for Otis to a high-end Category3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125mph (205km/h) by 21:00UTC (4:00p.m. CDT). Explosive intensification continued throughout the day into the nighttime hours, in what was described as a \"nightmare scenario\" by Eric Blake at the NHC. A prominent pinhole eye developed as the night progressed, surrounded by intense convection reaching \u2212112 to \u2212130\u00b0F (\u221280 to \u221290\u00b0C). Otis reached Category5 hurricane status by 03:00UTC on October25 (10:00p.m. CDT, October24) while located just 55mi (90km) south-southeast of Acapulco. An hour later it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 165mph (270km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 923mb (27.26inHg). Immense lightning activity occurred throughout the intensification phase, approximately 26,000 strikes in 24hours, with the greatest activity taking place in the 35minutes leading up to landfall. By 05:45UTC (12:45a.m. CDT), Isla de La Roqueta[es] entered the hurricane's eyewall and the storm's core made landfall just west of Acapulco around 06:25UTC (1:25a.m. CDT) at peak intensity. Once onshore, the hurricane rapidly weakened as it interacted with the mountains of the Sierra Madre del Sur. Within two hours, its eye disappeared from satellite imagery and lightning activity ceased. Utilizing statistical inland decay models, the NHC estimated Otis to have fallen below hurricane status by 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT). The storm's surface circulation dissipated shortly thereafter, marking the cessation of Otis's time as a tropical cyclone.\nThe rapid intensification of Otis was among the most poorly forecast in the modern era. Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Bob Henson at Yale University called the underestimation \"one of the biggest and most consequential forecast-model misses of recent years\". Numerical weather prediction models failed to capture the magnitude of explosive intensification that occurred, in part due to a dearth of data. Several experts, including director of the National Hurricane Center Michael Brennan, noted that there are very few instruments \u2014 such as ocean buoys or radar \u2014 available for evaluating hurricane strength in the East Pacific, leaving forecasters reliant on satellite data. As described by the New York Times, forecasts of Otis upon its formation on October22 \"didn\u2019t show much to be concerned about\". In their first advisory, the NHC forecast a peak intensity of just 45mph (75km/h), 120mph (195km/h) lower than its actual peak intensity, with the system moving north-northwest and later west away from the Mexican coastline. Forecasters John Cangialosi and Lisa Bucci noted that many models showed the storm outright dissipating within five days.\nEarly on October23, Blake noted that models were incorrectly diagnosing conditions and showing Otis intertwined with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. He adjusted his forecast to show a faster motion which would bring the system onto the Mexican coastline on October26. Later that day, forecasters Cangialosi and Sandy Delgado noted a substantial disparity in various model solutions, with results differing based on how vertically aligned the storm would become or not become. Conditions for a more potent system became more apparent during the overnight hours of October23\u201324. This included high sea surface temperatures, lower wind shear, and abundant moisture. The system also became vertically aligned. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) rapid intensification index increased to 25percent, leading forecasters to raise their intensity predictions above most model outputs. At 09:00UTC (4:00a.m. CDT) on October24, less than 24 hours before landfall, the NHC expected Otis to intensify into a Category1 hurricane as it moved ashore. Sixteen hours prior to landfall, the system was forecast to move ashore at least five hours later than it actually did. The dramatic rate of intensification was not apparent until reconnaissance aircraft sampled the storm during the afternoon of October24. At 00:00UTC on October25 (7:00p.m. CDT, October24), just under six and a half hours before the storm made landfall, the NHC upgraded Otis to a Category4 hurricane and explicitly forecast it to become a Category5 hurricane before making landfall.\nThe rate of Hurricane Otis's intensification was among the fastest observed in the satellite-era. In a 24-hour period, the hurricane's maximum sustained winds increased by 115mph (185km/h), ranking it as the second-fastest worldwide, only behind Hurricane Patricia in 2015, which increased by 120mph (195km/h). With winds of 165mph (270km/h), Otis became the first Pacific hurricane on record to make landfall at Category5 intensity, surpassing Hurricane Patricia accordingly. Overall, it was the fourth-strongest landfalling Mexican hurricane by sustained wind speed, behind the following Atlantic hurricanes, each with sustained winds of 175mph (280km/h): Janet in 1955, Anita in 1977, and Dean in 2007. Masters and Henson surmised Otis's landfall saw the most people to have experienced the eyewall of a Category5 hurricane. They further stated the only hurricane of comparison was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck the Miami metropolitan area at Category5 strength (producing such winds in parts of southern Miami-Dade County).\nThe Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch for areas east of Tecpan de Galeana to Lagunas de Chacahua at 03:00UTC October24. As the storm approached land and intensified further, a hurricane warning was issued for the Guerrero coastline between Punta Maldonado and Zihuatanejo at 09:00UTC October24, 21 hours before landfall. In response to the approach of Hurricane Otis, the Guerrero state government opened 396 shelters to accommodate residents displaced by the heavy wind and storm surge damage. Mexico's army and navy sent 8,000 troops to support aid and rescue operations. Authorities in Guerrero closed Acapulco's main port. Schools across Guerrero were to be closed ahead of Otis's anticipated landfall. All flights in and out of Acapulco International Airport were cancelled.\nIn its advisory upgrading Otis to a Category5 hurricane, 3 hours and 25 minutes before landfall, the NHC described the situation as a \"nightmare scenario\" and warned that \"This is an extremely serious situation for the Acapulco metropolitan area with the core of the destructive hurricane likely to come near or over that large city early on Wednesday. There are no hurricanes on record even close to this intensity for this part of Mexico\".\nHurricane Otis made landfall in Acapulco as a Category5 hurricane on October25, making it by far the strongest hurricane to ever strike this area of Mexico. On October30, the National Autonomous University of Mexico tweeted that data from two weather stations in Acapulco Bay were recovered. One station measured peak sustained winds of 113.64mph (182.88km/h) with a gust to 204.90mph (329.76km/h) at 05:40UTC (12:40a.m. CDT). A minimum pressure of 963.5mb (28.45inHg) was also observed at 05:50UTC (12:50a.m. CDT). A weather station on Isla de La Roqueta[es] offshore western Acapulco recorded a maximum wind gust of 135mph (217km/h) as the eyewall moved across the city. Peak sustained winds of 81mph (130km/h) were also reported by the station.\nAcross Guerrero, 37 transmission lines, 26 electrical substations, a power generation plant, and 10,000 light poles were downed, resulting in more than 500,000 households losing power, although service was quickly restored to 200,000 and was fully restored on November 1. Throughout Acapulco, 51,864 houses were destroyed, while 79,510 others suffered severe damage and 80,823 other homes suffered minor or moderate damage. A total of 3,813 people necessitated air rescue through 62 flights while 20,047 others evacuated via bus. About 80% of all hotels in Acapulco sustained damage, including reports of flooding and collapsed ceilings inside hotels. Several buildings were also heavily damaged or collapsed. Eighteen radio stations in Acapulco were downed, and communication was cut off in the city. The city also lost access to drinking water. A total of 110 medical facilities were out of operation due to the storm, but 80% of such facilities had re-opened by November 7. Five shopping centers necessitated closure, although four re-opened within a week and a half. Additionally, a shopping center in Acapulco was destroyed, and a section of a highway leading into the city was closed after a landslide. Forty-one sections of highways were damaged throughout Guerrero. A large amount of the state's crop yields, which was valued at 25.2 billion pesos in 2022, was destroyed. Offshore, 480 public tourist boats were destroyed. At least 33 vessels sunk in Acapulco Bay. Five boats were rescued offshore Playa Manzanillo while two small vessels were found in the bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s. Further inland, ten road accidents occurred in the Toluca Valley in the state of Mexico, resulting in two deaths. Statewide, 478 individuals were injured, 98 of whom required hospitalization.\nSeveral airlines were impacted by Otis, with service on Aerom\u00e9xico, Volaris, and Viva Aerobus affected and suspended at Acapulco and Zihuatanejo. Acapulco International Airport, which was closed to all flights, was inaccessible. Additionally, the Pie de la Cuesta Air Force Base near Acapulco was damaged, which made it difficult for rescue operations. Otis's passage knocked offline a significant part of the seismic network in Guerrero owned by SkyAlert, an earthquake warning app used widely in Mexico, as well as the SASMEX Network, another network owned by CIRES, responsible of broadcasting alerts through public speakers and radio signals. Twenty-seven sensors were affected throughout Guerrero and parts of neighboring states Michoac\u00e1n and Oaxaca, as well as two broadcast towers in the cities of Acapulco and Chilpancingo, hindering the ability to notify major cities both close and farther away prone to damage in case an earthquake occurs along the coasts of those three states. By October 28, 19 of the sensors had been restored.\nLosses were estimated at US$15 billion by the natural disaster risk analysis firm Enki Research, and at more than US$10 billion by global reinsurance firm Gallagher Re., meaning Otis possibly exceeds Hurricane Wilma as Mexico's most expensive weather disaster ever recorded at US$7.5 billion. Fitch Ratings estimated that Otis was responsible for US$16 billion in insured losses. Tourism authorities considered Otis the worst hurricane to hit Acapulco, with its impact more severe than both Hurricane Pauline and Hurricane Manuel. Government officials believed that it would cost between 200 and 300 billion pesos (US$11.4 and 17.2 billion) to repair the damage in Acapulco. Officials estimated that as a result of the storm, the Guerrero gross domestic product will decline by 16% by the start of 2024. Citigroup estimated that economic activity in the final quarter of 2023 would shrink by 40% due to the hurricane. According to Reuters, Mexican business groups estimate damage at $16 billion as of November17, 2023.\nAs of December21, 2023, the official figures stand at 52 people killed and 32 missing, with three foreigners included in the death toll as well as at least two students attending the Autonomous University of Guerrero (AUG). In the village of Kil\u00f3metro 30, a two-year-old girl was swept away by floodwaters after she left her mother's arms. A total of 59 people were reported missing, including 11 Americans and 7 other foreign nationals. Early media reports of an additional 16 fatalities following a power outage at a Mexican Social Security Institute hospital were denied by the government. Local officials told the Washington Post that they had counted 120 dead or missing, including 20 bodies that washed up onto Acapulco beach or by the docks, 10 bodies that were found floating in the ocean 16 kilometres (10mi) west of Acapulco, two people who were missing from a vessel of three, and three people who died at sea on a four-person boat.\nLocals have criticized the official death toll as an underestimate, to which President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador responded by accusing his opponents of making the death toll a political issue. At the time of the first death toll estimate of 27, L\u00f3pez Obrador said that \"even though the death of any person is unfortunate, there weren't very many\". On November 12, a report emerged indicating that Acapulco's funeral homes had calculated a total of at least 350 deaths. The following day, municipal authorities dismissed the report as \"speculation\" and, during a press conference, L\u00f3pez Obrador reiterated that the official death toll remained at 48.\nAccording to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the state of Guerrero was the least prepared state for a natural disaster. Although there were 14 civil protection public servants per 100,000 inhabitants, half of those are dedicated to administrative functions, one quarter of those are firefighters, and less than 15% of servants can aid in search and rescue. Nevertheless, the government of Guerrero mobilized 30 to 40 trucks to transport displaced tourists to shelter. With resources totaling approximately US$1.7 billion, the government initially believed it had the economic resources necessary to repair the damage to Guerrero, although the congressional bloc of Morena offered an additional 10 million pesos in aid on October 26. On November 1, the federal government announced 61.3 billion pesos in investments for reconstruction, including 18 billion for infrastructure recovery and 10 billion worth of tax breaks, 45,000 additional scholarships to Acapulco students, hiring 10,000 young people to aid in cleanup efforts, and free electricity through February 2024. On November 3, the federal government announced that each of the 250,000 affected families in Acapulco and Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez would receive weekly baskets of foodstuffs over the following three months, totaling between 2 billion and 3 billion pesos. However, the federal government rejected calls from the Chamber of Deputies to use oil surpluses, estimated to total up to 80 billion pesos, to fund additional recovery efforts. Citigroup criticized the federal government package as insufficient. A sit in outside the National Palace was organized to protest the lack of government assistance, in which 50 people participated. Victims petitioned the Mexican Senate to demand the establishment of a 300 billion pesos trust.\nIn addition to financial assistance, 47 of Guerrero's 81 municipalities were initially declared a disaster area, but this was later reduced to cover only two municipalities (Acapulco and Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez). Ten doctors from Michoac\u00e1n were flown in to Acapulco to assist with recovery efforts. By October 28, the government provided 8,100 liters (1,800impgal; 2,100U.S.gal) of food supplies and 16,000 liters (3,500impgal; 4,200U.S.gal) of water to Acapulco. By November 1, the government had delivered 63,000 food packages and 1,600,000 liters (350,000impgal; 420,000U.S.gal) of water. By November 4, the government had delivered 1,874,400 liters (412,300impgal; 495,200U.S.gal) of water, including to 11,350,000 liters (2,500,000impgal; 3,000,000U.S.gal) to hospitals, 60,000 liters (13,000impgal; 16,000U.S.gal) to shelters, and 385,000 liters (85,000impgal; 102,000U.S.gal) to water treatment plants. By November 5, they delivered 204,092 meals. By November 7, 8,602 kilograms (18,964lb) of crgo had been airlifted. A total of 37,000 liters (8,100impgal; 9,800U.S.gal) of diesel, 80,000 liters (18,000impgal; 21,000U.S.gal) of gasoline and 35,000 liters (7,700impgal; 9,200U.S.gal) of jet fuel was distributed by the government. The military distributed 97,805 food supplies, 36,400 kilograms (80,200lb) of tortillas, and 145,000 food rations through 13 dining rooms and five community kitchens. The Mexican Navy alone provided 4,000 groceries, 156,450 liters (34,410impgal; 41,330U.S.gal) of water, over 13,000 kilograms (29,000lb) of supplies, including 2,000 kilograms (4,400lb) of personal hygiene and medical items, and packaged 33,243 meals. At the naval hospital, 1,037 medical consultations were given, including 16 surgeries. The military also provided 2,345 medical consultations and made 11 medical evacuations, 10 by air and 1 by land. On November 2, they distributed 120,000 liters (26,000impgal; 32,000U.S.gal) to five hospitals in Acapulco, which were operating at 10% of capacity. By November 3, normal operations had been reestablished at 37 gas stations, with a total inventory of 24,500,000 liters (5,400,000impgal; 6,500,000U.S.gal) of fuel. By November 6, normal operations had been resumed at 60 gas stations, or 75% of gas stations in Acapulco. Local authorities estimated that they had cleaned up 250 metric tons (250 long tons; 280 short tons) of garbage along coastal areas of Acapulco.\nThe Tax Administration Service (SAT) delayed all tax deadlines for residents until November 10. The Secretary of National Defense launched a food collection drive in Nuevo Laredo. The Mexican Red Cross delivered 75 metric tons (74 long tons; 83 short tons) of humanitarian aid and mobilized 300 volunteers in Acapulco. Walmart offered to match all donations made to the victims of the storm. Banco Santander offered to suspend loan payments for all victims for six months. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) delivered 562,000kg (1,239,000lb) of aid. AUG provided 50 buses for victims to travel between Acapulco and Chilpancingo. The United States government provided Mexico with equipment to re-open the roads and said it would honor any requests from the Mexican government for assistance. The Association of Banks of Mexico launched a payment deferral program that an estimated 300,000 individuals were eligible for, totaling 22 billion pesos. Some tolls on Federal Highway 95D were lifted in order to aid in relief efforts. Free bus service was offered from Acapulco to Mexico City through November 5. Telmex offered free services for all of Acaupulco for Novedmber and December 2023. Eleven charging stations were opened in which individuals could use for up to 15 minutes. Widespread looting also occurred throughout the city after the storm, prompting President L\u00f3pez Obrador to deploy 14,700 members of the National Guard to erect checkpoints and resulting in a 70% increase in food prices.\nDespite the damage, some hotels sought to resume operations in time for the holiday season. In addition, 35 hotels promised the federal government that they would re-open by the end of March 2024. The Secretariat of Tourism also announced that the Tianguis Tur\u00edstico[es] annual tourism fair set to be held in Acapulco in April 2024 would not be cancelled.",

        "title": "2024 Noto earthquake",
        "text": "On 1 January 2024, at 16:10 JST (07:10 UTC), a MJMA7.6 (Mw7.5) earthquake struck 6km (3.7mi) north-northeast of Suzu, located on the Noto Peninsula of Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. The reverse-faulting shock achieved a maximum JMA seismic intensity of Shindo 7 and Modified Mercalli intensity of X\u2013XI (Extreme). The shaking and accompanying tsunami caused widespread destruction on the Noto Peninsula, particularly in the towns of Suzu, Wajima, Noto and Anamizu, with the neighbouring prefectures of Toyama and Niigata also recording significant damage. As of 28 February 2024, there were 241 deaths confirmed and 12 people remaining missing, all of them in Ishikawa, with 1,294 others injured across six prefectures, making it the deadliest earthquake in Japan since the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes. As of 20 February, 12,929 people remained in 521 evacuation centers.\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) officially named this earthquake the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake (Japanese: \u4ee4\u548c6\u5e74\u80fd\u767b\u534a\u5cf6\u5730\u9707, Hepburn: Reiwa 6-nen Noto-hant\u014d Jishin). It led to Japan's first major tsunami warning since the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, and a tsunami of 6.58m (22ft) was measured along the Sea of Japan coast.\nThe Noto Peninsula lies on the southeastern margin of the Sea of Japan, which was formed by back-arc rifting related to subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate along the Japan Trench. This process began during the Early Miocene, ending in the Middle Miocene. By the late Pliocene the tectonic regime changed to compression, probably associated with collision between the Izu\u2013Bonin Arc and Honshu. This led to reactivation of the rift faults in reverse sense, combined with inversion of the basins formed by these faults. Currently Japan is situated on the convergent boundaries between the Pacific, Philippine Sea, Okhotsk and Amurian Plates. Along the island arc's east and southeast coasts, subduction of the Pacific and Philippine Sea Plates occurs at the Japan Trench and Nankai Trough, respectively. The west coast of Honshu, bordering the Sea of Japan, is a north\u2013south trending convergent boundary between the Amurian and Okhotsk Plates. It has been proposed that it is an incipient subduction zone, consisting of eastward-dipping thrust faults.\nThe rifting and subsequent inversion has created a series of faults along the coast that have the potential to move and cause earthquakes, in the range of Mw\u202f6.8\u20137.9, in many cases with tsunamis. Major earthquakes and tsunamis along this boundary occurred in 1833, 1940, 1964, 1983 and 1993. The largest and most destructive tsunami in the Sea of Japan occurred in 1741 and was attributed to the eruption of Oshima. A fault known as the F43 (in the list of 60 faults evaluated) reaches the seabed just north of the Noto peninsula trending WSW\u2013ENE. This southeast-dipping fault, which consists of two segments with a combined length of 94.2km (58.5mi), has been judged to be capable of producing an earthquake of Mw\u202f7.6.\nThe northeastern tip of the Noto Peninsula has been subject to an earthquake swarm for the last three years, with the largest earthquake being a MJMA 6.5 event that took place in May 2023. The 1 January 2024 mainshock was the strongest to hit the peninsula since records began in 1885.\nThe swarm began in December 2020 at depths greater than 15km (9.3mi) beneath the peninsula's northeast. By mid-March 2021, the earthquake swarm migrated to shallower depths above 15km (9.3mi). Most earthquakes after May 2021 occurred at 10\u201315km (6.2\u20139.3mi) depth. The Mw\u202f 7.5 earthquake occurring after the swarm was deemed \"rare\". The general understanding of earthquake swarms are that due to the high intensity in crustal fracturing, such areas experiencing them are unlikely to generate large earthquakes. The swarm may have been triggered by the intrusion of fluids at deeper depths in response to crustal deformation.\nFluid upwelling is thought to be occurring beneath the peninsula as evidenced by a rise of 70mm (2.8in) on the surface above the swarm. Seismologists considered the swarm unexpected as the peninsula lacked active volcanic or geothermal features to produce high-pressure fluids that would promote such seismic activity. These fluids may have originated from the upple mantle and migrated upwards into the crust through faults. Lubricated by fluids, these faults began producing earthquakes. No direct connection between the swarm and mainshock has been established, however, the swarm may have induced stress on these faults as they moved.\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a focal depth of 10km (6.2mi) for the earthquake. The Japan Meteorological Agency recorded a magnitude of MJMA\u202f 7.6. It was the largest earthquake to strike Ishikawa since at least 1885, and the largest to strike Mainland Japan since the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake.\nThe focal mechanism of the mainshock corresponded to shallow reverse faulting along a northeast-trending plane dipping northwest or southeast, happening along the convergent boundary between the Okhotsk Plate and Amurian Plate. A magnitude 5.8 foreshock struck four minutes before the mainshock, while a magnitude 6.2 aftershock struck nine minutes later. More than 1,200 aftershocks were recorded across a 100km (62mi) zone. At least seven of them registered a magnitude of 5.0 and above.\nAccording to a finite fault model released by the USGS, the earthquake rupture extended over 160km (99mi) by 20km (12mi) from the southwestern Noto Peninsula to Sado Island along a southeast-dipping fault. Slip was mostly concentrated entirely beneath the peninsula. The zones of the largest slip occurred southwest of the hypocenter while little to no slip on the segment offshore between the peninsula and island. The patch immediately southwest of the epicenter produced the displacement of 5.992m (20ft) beneath the peninsula's coast. Another zone of slip occurred further southwest beneath the same stretch of coastline, producing up to 6.030m (20ft) of slip beneath Motoichi. The fault likely ruptured towards the seafloor at the peninsula while little to no slip was observed on the seafloor between the peninsula and Sado Island. The entire rupture process took about 50 seconds with the greatest phase of seismic moment release occurring some 25 seconds after initiation.\nDue to the lack of significant slip on the segment offshore between the peninsula and Sado Island, seismologist Kenji Satake said there is still potential for another magnitude 7.0 or larger earthquake and tsunami. Research led by Kimiyuki Asano at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute at Kyoto University analysed waveform recorded by seismometers and determined the earthquake consisted of two subevents. The first subevent, measuring MJMA\u202f 7.3, ruptured a fault beneath the peninsula, causing coastal uplift. A second subevent identical in magnitude ruptured the offshore segment 13 seconds after the completion of the first subevent.\nAbout 85km (53mi) of coastline spanning Suzu, Wajima and Shika was raised and the shore moved seawards by up to 200m (660ft). Wajima's Minazuki Bay was uplifted 4m (13ft) while at Nagahashimachi's fishing port, a tide gauge was rendered unusable because the seafloor was exposed.\nThe Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) said parts of the country moved up to 1.3m (4ft 3in) westwards with the maximum displacement observed at Wajima due to crustal deformation. At Anamizu, land shifted 1m (3ft 3in) westwards. However, the agency said these movements could be slope or local ground movement instead. The agency also added that crustal uplift of 4m (13ft) occurred in western Wajima and 1.1m (3ft 7in) in northern Suzu. Near Wajima's port, the shoreline of a sandy beach was moved 250m (820ft) seawards due to the coastal uplift. Uplift at Kaiso Fishing Port in Wajima by 4m (13ft) exposed parts of the seafloor.\nThe coastline in the Kawaura district of Suzu moved 175m (574ft) seawards due to the coastal uplift, while the land area expanded by a total of 2.4 square kilometers. A port in the Ozawa district of Wajima was entirely drained. A seaward movement of 240m (790ft) was detected in the coasts of Monzenmachi and Kuroshimamachi districts in Wajima, as well as an expansion of 4.4km (1.7sqmi) in the Noto Peninsula. Areas in the northern part of the peninsula were also found to have risen while the southern sections, particularly in Anamizu, had subsided.\nThe GSI said due to the land expansion by 4.4km (1.7sqmi), Ishikawa Prefecture may have become larger than Fukui Prefecture in land area. The latter, having an area of 4,190.54km (1,617.98sqmi), is 4.34km (1.68sqmi) larger than Ishikawa Prefecture, according to a survey in October 2023. However, this difference was expected to be temporary due to the effects of sea erosion.\nAcross the mountainous region of the peninsula, landslides were widespread. There was also extensive slope failures, particularly in the northeastern part of the peninsula. The number of landslides was estimated at 1,000. At least nine landslide dams were discovered in the Wajima area on 9 January, which had the potential to cause debris avalanches. In Wajima, a landslide dam caused water to overflow downstream into fields, potentially causing a collapse. In J\u014detsu, Niigata, a landslide measuring 16,000m (570,000cuft) buried a section of National Route 8.\nA scarp trending east\u2013west across a zone 4km (2.5mi) long and 0.1\u20130.4km (0.062\u20130.249mi) wide occurred along the Wakayama River in Suzu. The maximum vertical offset was 2.2m (7ft 3in) in Naka district, Wakayama town. These scarps did not display any observable horizontal displacement. It propagated through and displaced rice fields, roads and rivers among other features. The GSI said these scarps may represent a fold in response to compressive forces due to the geology of the area. However, they did not rule out the scarp being the toe of a landslide, though this is a less probable explanation.\nSurveys by the Japan Coast Guard revealed a section of uplifted seafloor south of the active fault trace. The seabed north of the Noto Peninsula lies 40\u201390m (130\u2013300ft) beneath the sea. The recent survey and survey results from the previous year suggested a 3m (9.8ft) uplift of the seafloor.\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said it recorded a maximum seismic intensity of 7 (Shindo 7), the highest level on its seismic intensity scale, the first time that an earthquake of that intensity had been observed in the country since 2018. It corresponded to a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of X\u2013XI (Extreme). The maximum intensity was reported in Shika and Wajima, Ishikawa Prefecture. Intensity 6+ was recorded in Nanao, Suzu and Anamizu. Intensity 6\u2013 was recorded in Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture and in Ishikawa's Nakanoto and Noto. The earthquake was also felt by residents in Tokyo and across the Kanto Region and as far as Aomori Prefecture in the northern tip of Honshu to Kyushu in the south of the country. A peak ground acceleration of 2,826 gal was observed in Shika, which was close to that recorded during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake which measured 2,934 gal. Due to the ground beneath Wajima and Anamizu comprising soft sediments, ground motions were amplified.\nThe JMA also reported that the Noto Region of Ishikawa Prefecture registered the highest possible Long Period Ground Motion (LPGM) intensity of 4.\nNote 1: According to the JMA, this aftershock only lasted a few seconds and the measured intensities around the Shindo 6\u2212 point were much lower than what would be expected of an earthquake of that intensity. An investigation is ongoing.\nNote 2: According to a report of the JMA, this aftershock caused a Tsunami Forecast, for waves up to 20cm (7.9in) in Ishikawa, Niigata and Sado Island areas.\nLarge parts of Japan's western coast, from Hokkaido to Nagasaki Prefectures were immediately placed under a tsunami warning after the earthquake struck, with evacuation orders issued in Ishikawa, Niigata, Toyama, and Yamagata prefectures. The earthquake triggered a major tsunami warning, the first one since the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake. Public broadcaster NHK said tsunami waves of 5m (16ft) could be expected. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said dangerous tsunami waves were possible within 300km (190mi) of the epicenter.\nThe evacuation orders covered 62,000 people, with 1,000 evacuees finding shelter at the Japan Air Self-Defense Force base in Wajima in Ishikawa Prefecture. The major tsunami warning was later downgraded to a tsunami warning at 20:30, about four hours after the earthquake. These tsunami warnings were later downgraded to advisories, which were eventually lifted at 10:01 on 2 January, about 18 hours after the earthquake.\nThe first waves were reported to have arrived at around 16:21, although a team of researchers from Tohoku University's International Research Institute of Disaster Science said the first waves reached the Noto Peninsula within a minute of the earthquake. In Suzu, the first waves were estimated to arrive one minute after the shock and two minutes later at Nanao. They also estimated Toyama was struck by the waves in about five minutes. The quicker-than-anticipated tsunami arrival meant people did not evacuate in time. Fumihiko Imamura, a member of the research team, said it may have been due to the close proximity of the fault to the coast or a possible submarine landslide in Toyama Bay. Tsunamis in the Sea of Japan have been observed to arrive faster than those along Japan's Pacific coast. Tsunami modelling executed by the University of Tokyo and Building Research Institute of Japan computed the tsunami to be 3.6m (12ft) in Suzu; 3m (9.8ft) in Noto; 2.5m (8ft 2in) in Shika and 2m (6ft 7in) in J\u014detsu, Niigata.\nFlooding by the tsunami exceeded 4m (13ft) along the east and western part of the peninsula. In Suzu, the highest waves exceeded 4.7m (15ft) at Misaka Town, destroying homes and damaging the seawall. At Shika's Kagami area, the tsunami was recorded at 5.1m (17ft). A run-up of about 4.2m (14ft) was estimated at Shika based on the survey of warehouses and port facilities. Aerial photographs of Suzu suggested a wave height of 3m (9.8ft) above sea level; subsequent analysis indicated a wave of 4.5m (15ft) at Nanba, Misakimachi. Tsunami waves exceeding 1.2m (4ft) struck Wajima, however data from the tide gauge was incomplete as it was one of several tide gauges across the peninsula that stopped receiving information shortly after. A tide gauge at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant recorded a rise of 3m (9.8ft) in tide level at between 17:45 and 18:00. The plant's operator later said that a 3m (9.8ft) wave reached the facility, which was built at an elevation of 11m (36ft) above sea level and had a seawall measuring 4m (13ft) high, at 17:45, without causing damage.\nA tsunami measuring 90cm (35in) struck Kanazawa, while a tsunami of 80cm (31in) struck Toyama Prefecture and Sakata, Yamagata Prefecture. Waves measuring 50cm (20in) were recorded in Nanao and Tsuruga while waves measuring 40cm (16in) were recorded at Kashiwazaki, Tobishima, and Sado Island. In Toyama city, a 0.5m (1ft 8in) wave was reported. The tsunami was recorded in Tottori Prefecture with heights of 0.6m (2ft 0in) in Sakaiminato and 0.2m (7.9in) in Iwami; in Toyooka, Hyogo Prefecture, it reached 0.4m (1ft 4in). A 0.4m (1ft 4in) tsunami was recorded at the port area of Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture. In Hokkaido, waves of up to 60cm (24in) were reported in Setana, while 50cm (20in) waves struck Okushiri Island.\nThe highest tsunami wave reached 6.58m (21.6ft) at a public park 600m (2,000ft) from the Seki River mouth. The tsunami swept people away at the entrance of a building and in the park. The locally high waves may be attributed to the seafloor bathymetry concentrating the tsunami at a specific location. Video footage in J\u014detsu, Niigata showed the tsunami approaching the rivermouth at 16:35, crashing into embankments and causing seawater to overflow. Evidence of tsunami sediments and marine flora suggested the tsunami reached at least 5.5km (3.4mi) upstream from the river mouth. It also flowed along the Hokura River for 1.6km (0.99mi) starting from its confluence at the Seki River. Wave heights along the coast southwest of the rivermouth were between 1.5m (4ft 11in) and 5.0m (16.4ft). Northeast of the rivermouth, they ranged from 1.8m (5ft 11in) to 4.0m (13.1ft). At Naoetsu beach, tsunami debris indicated 2m (6ft 7in) waves struck while 3km (1.9mi) to the west in Tanhama beach, waves were estimated at 4m (13ft).\nIn Suzu, the tsunami was said to have arrived a minute following the earthquake. Homes were washed off their foundations and some were driven further inland. At least one person was killed by the tsunami. The earthquake and tsunami damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the town's buildings. The tsunami capsized many fishing vessels and carried some onto land. Building collapses and overturned cars were observed from a news helicopter flyover of the city. A resident recalled tsunami waves washing over a road, picking up cars and debris; he also estimated the waves were 3m (9.8ft) above tide level. Ishikawa Prefecture's governor, Hiroshi Hase, said the tsunami flooded the Iida Port area by up to 100m (330ft) inland. A study conducted by Professor Shunichi Koshimura of Tohoku University found that the damage in Suzu was exacerbated by the seabed terrain of Toyama Bay.\nIn Shika, a series of tsunami waves reached the port at 17:40. The tsunami which had a 4.2m (14ft) run-up damaged the city's fishing port and its facilities. Tsunami observations in the peninsula were made difficult by the coastal uplift raising parts of the coast by up to 4.1m (13ft) and extending the coastline further seawards.\nIn the Shiromaru area of Noto, Ishikawa, homes were washed away and a fire was started. About 4.6ha (11 acres) of coastline was damaged. On Hegurajima, the tsunami flooded homes and disabled basic services. Three people were stranded on the island prior to rescue two weeks later. A run-up of 5m (16ft) on the island was determined. In Kurikawashiri, Noto, inundation was observed 700m (2,300ft) inland. In Shiromaru, Noto, the tsunami exceeded 4m (13ft) and may have been higher than 5m (16ft), which resulted in heavy damage. These run-up heights were determined with elevation data before the earthquake; due to the interference of coastal uplift, these wave heights may be larger than evaluated.\nIn J\u014detsu, Niigata, the locally-high run-up exceeding 6m (20ft) flooded 15 homes along the Seki River bank. Beach houses and other buildings were also swept away. Ten fishing vessels capsized in the Ogata Fishing Port area. Containers were also washed away and warehouses storing machinery were flooded. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) assessed that the tsunami inundated up to 190ha (470 acres) of land in Suzu, Noto and Shika, and damaged breakwaters in at least seven beaches. At least 120 maritime vessels were reported to have been sunk or capsized from the tsunami, while at least 70 percent of ports in Ishikawa Prefecture sustained damage. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said that 60 out of 69 fishing ports in Ishikawa Prefecture were affected by the tsunami, 18 of which were completely unusable and nine others partially functional.\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration warned that the coastlines of Gangwon Province and Pohang in South Korea could experience a rise in sea levels. Waves of 0.3m (1ft) were anticipated along the nation's east coast from 18:29 to 19:17 local time. A 0.45m (1ft 6in) tsunami was later reported to have occurred in Gangwon. A 0.85m (3ft) high wave reportedly struck Mukho at around 20:00 local time. Tsunamis with heights of 0.66m (2ft 2in) were recorded in Uljin; 0.45m (1ft 6in) in Sokcho and 0.39m (1ft 3in) in Gangneung. It is thought to be the first tsunami of over 0.5m (1ft 8in) observed in the country since 1993. According to Yonhap News Agency, citing North Korean state radio, a tsunami warning was issued with waves of 2.08m (6ft 10in) potentially hitting the country's east coast.\nWarnings were also issued in Russia for tsunami waves estimated to reach 1m (3ft), particularly along the west coast of Sakhalin Island, where evacuations were said to be conducted, although Russia later said that no evacuations were taking place there. Tsunami warnings were also declared in parts of Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsk Krai, Vladivostok and Nakhodka. The Emergencies Ministry of Russia said \"response teams are ready to deal with the possible consequences of a tsunami.\" Officials in Vladivostok later said \"no tsunami was observed\" while in Nakhodka, \"the tsunami passed almost unnoticed.\" A 0.63m (2ft 1in) wave was observed at Preobrazhenie in Primorsky Krai; at Kholmsk, it measured 0.18m (7.1in).\nThe earthquake struck as Japan was marking New Year's Day, a public holiday when many were at home and most establishments were closed. At least 241 deaths occurred in Ishikawa Prefecture; 103 in Suzu, 102 in Wajima, 20 in Anamizu, eight in Noto, five in Nanao, two in Shika and one in Hakui. Fifteen people died in the aftermath due to injuries or illnesses. More than 80 percent of the deaths were due to collapsed homes. Additionally, one person was killed by the tsunami. At least 1,188 people were injured in the prefecture, 312 of them seriously, and as of 1 February, 12 people remained missing. Information provided by the National Police Agency following autopsies found that 92 of the victims were crushed to death, 49 died of suffocation or respiratory failure, 32 died from hypothermia, and three died of burns. More than 70 percent of those killed were from the elderly.\nThe Japanese government estimated the total coast of damage in Ishikawa, Toyama and Niigata at \u00a52.6 trillion ($17.6 billion). Most of the cost was attributed to damaged homes, roads, ports and other infrastructure. Ishikawa Prefecture accounted for between \u00a50.9 and \u00a51.3 trillion ($6.1 and $8.8 billion). Damage was especially severe in Wajima and Suzu. At least 780 people across 30 districts in remote villages were isolated due to damaged roads and landslides and required helicopters to be reached. Many of the collapsed houses in Wajima were traditional wooden structures that were built prior to current building regulations that were imposed in 1981, which was equivalent to around 56.4 percent of the town's buildings. Information from 2018 also revealed that more than half of buildings in Wajima did not follow these regulations. In Suzu, many buildings were built before the enactment of modern building codes in 1950, while in 2019, only 51 percent of the town's houses were deemed earthquake-resistant, compared with 87 percent for the entire country. Around 66 percent of residences in Suzu were wooden homes that were built before 1980, while 61 percent of buildings in Noto were found to have been built before 1981.\nAt least 93,522 structures, including 78,402 houses, 185 public buildings and 14,935 of unspecified use, were damaged across Ishikawa, including 18,139 which were partially or completely destroyed. In Wajima, 3,670 houses collapsed, 3,602 others were partially destroyed and 6,802 others were damaged, along with 6,687 buildings. Ninety percent of the fatalities there were attributed to falling debris from collapsed houses. A fire occurred in the city at around 17:00. Due to damaged roads, firefighters were unable to extinguish the flames. The fire consumed an estimated 200 buildings, including many homes, and the Asaichi morning market, a 1,000-year-old shopping district and tourist attraction that hosted about 200 stalls. An area of up to 48,000m (520,000sqft) was affected by the fire, which experts said was exacerbated by the loss of water supply and the tsunami warning, which prevented firefighters from responding immediately to the blaze. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency later said that the fire may have been caused by electrical wiring that had been damaged by the earthquake. At least 516 people were injured in the city. In Suzu, there were 249 injuries and up to 90 percent of the buildings were affected. In the city, 3,001 buildings completely collapsed, 2,366 others were partially destroyed and 6,907 were damaged, including 3,621 houses. Fires also caused severe damage to many buildings. Damage and casualties in the city were exacerbated by previous earthquakes, most notably a MJMA6.5 event in May 2023 which damaged or destroyed a quarter of Suzu's houses. Many people were still residing in these damaged houses at the time of the earthquake. The mayor of Suzu said about 4,000 to 5,000 households of the city's 6,000 were no longer habitable, adding that damage was \"catastrophic\".\nThe Ishikawa Nanao Police Station said collapsed homes trapped people before they were rescued.

Two injuries were also reported each in Osaka and Hy\u014dgo Prefectures, while one person each was injured in Gifu and Nagano prefectures; in Nagano, four houses were partially damaged.\nCracked roads and broken water mains were reported in the cities of Himi and Oyabe, Toyama Prefecture. Residents of Himi experienced water outages lasting nearly two weeks, with orders to conserve water lasting until February. In Toyama prefecture, underground snow-removal equipment for city roads was damaged in multiple areas, resulting in the deployment of snowplows and other equipment following heavy snowfall on 23 January. Liquefaction occurred in Uozu and in Niigata city; sewer pipes also ruptured and many homes were left without water. Thirty homes in Nishi-ku were damaged. The Onohiyoshi Shrine in Kanazawa also sustained damage. A landslide struck the main expressway between Toyama and Kanazawa, ripping apart several hundred meters of roadway. Four houses along a hill fell over as the land under them collapsed in the eastern part of Kanazawa. Sections of Japan National Route 8 was buried by landslides in J\u014detsu, while track foundations caved in at the JR Echigo Line. A bridge along the Kurobe Gorge Railway, a popular tourist line, was damaged due to falling rocks. Cracks also appeared at the N\u014detsu Expressway.\nAround 260 convenience stores in the affected areas belonging to 7-11 and Family Mart were closed, while deliveries were delayed due to road closures. Japan Post also suspended services to the Noto Peninsula until 12 January due to road closures. NTT Docomo, Rakuten Mobile, Softbank and KDDI reported telecommunications and internet service disruptions in Ishikawa and Niigata prefectures, while NTT West said its facilities were damaged by the earthquake. At Shika Nuclear Power Plant, an explosion occurred near the power transformer of the No. 2 reactor, while the transformer at the No. 1 reactor was rendered inoperable due to an oil spill. The site's 4m (13ft) high seawall was found to have tilted by around several centimeters following the earthquake. At the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata prefecture, water spilled from the fuel pools of two reactors due to the force of the earthquake. Traditional industries were also affected, with the Ishikawa Sake Brewers Association saying the earthquake left all 11 manufacturers in the Oku-Noto region, which includes Wajima and Suzu, unable to operate, with five of them suffering complete destruction of their facilities.\nAt least 36,000 households and 19 medical facilities lost power following the earthquake and more than 110,000 households were left without water. By the morning of 3 January, the number of households without power had dropped to approximately 33,900. A month after the earthquake, water shortages continued to affect about 37,000 households, with full restoration of services not expected until April. In Shika, water was being rationed daily at six litres per person following the earthquake.\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology reported that 276 educational facilities had been damaged by the earthquake, particularly in Niigata, Ishikawa, Toyama, Fukui and Shiga prefectures. It also said 39 schools in four prefectures had been converted to evacuation shelters. The ministry also reported damage to 20 cultural sites in Toyama and Niigata prefectures. Several stone lanterns collapsed at the Zuiry\u016b-ji temple in Takaoka, which is a designated National Treasure, while a slope collapsed at the Sado mine. About 350 people across evacuation centers were infected by COVID-19 or the common flu, while at least 40 cases of gastrointestinal illnesses such as norovirus were detected. In Suzu, a 90-year-old woman was rescued from a collapsed house after 124 hours.\nThe KAGRA Gravitational-wave observatory in the northernmost part of Gifu Prefecture, which was in the process of upgrading its systems for the fourth observing run, suffered damage to the instruments and was forced to delay its planned Spring 2024 return to operations in order to assess and repair the damage.\nA review conducted after the earthquake found that Ishikawa Prefecture's disaster preparedness plan had been insufficient to handle the event. It found that the plan had not been significantly updated since 1997 and made only provisions for a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that would be localized in scope and classified as a low-level disaster with only three deaths, 120 destroyed buildings and 2,781 evacuees.\nThe governor of Ishikawa Prefecture, Hiroshi Hase, said that the earthquake had produced at least 2.4 million tons of waste, equivalent to seven-years' worth of waste produced in the prefecture, with 60 percent of it originating in Suzu, Wajima, Noto and Anamizu, which was also equivalent to 60 years' worth of waste produced in these towns.\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the establishment of a special emergency center to gather and disseminate information on the earthquake and tsunami. Defense minister Minoru Kihara ordered the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) to assist in rescue efforts. He later announced the deployment of 2,000 JSDF personnel to the affected region, with 8,500 others on standby. About 20 JSDF aircraft were also dispatched to survey the damage. An additional 2,000 firefighters and 1,000 police officers were also deployed to assist in rescue operations. About 3,000 rescuers were sent to the Noto Peninsula alone. By 4 January, at least 150 people had been rescued, while at least 2,000 of the 10,000 evacuees from Wajima had received humanitarian aid.\nThe Japanese government announced that it would allocate 4 billion yen ($28 million) from reserve funds to use in disaster relief efforts and increased the number of JSDF personnel involved in the response to 6,300. Defence Minister Kihara added that UH60JA helicopters were to be used in relief efforts, in their first major deployment since the 2023 Miyakojima helicopter crash in April. The Japanese government also announced that families whose houses were completely destroyed or severely damaged would receive aid amounting to 3 million yen ($20,000). Kishida later said that the government would allocate a total of 100 billion yen ($690 million) in reconstruction efforts and increase its reserve funds to $6.9 billion in the upcoming annual budget to ensure support for recovery efforts.\nIshikawa, Niigata, Toyama and Fukui prefectures requested financial support for 47 municipalities under the Disaster Relief Act, under which the national government is expected to cover 50 to 90 percent of expenses for disaster response and rehabilitation. The Japanese health ministry also instructed hospitals to offer health insurance coverage to patients affected by the quake, including those without insurance certificates and opened a telephone interpreting service in 23 languages to help medical workers handle foreign patients in the affected areas. Authorities in Ishikawa prefecture also opened an email help line to assist affected residents and tourists.\nOn 4 January, the Japan Coast Guard began searching its coast with an aircraft and patrol boat for people missing; presumably swept away by the tsunami. At least one person was declared missing from the tsunami. At least two people were rescued after the expiration of the 72-hour survival window in Wajima on 4 January. Large holes in roads and landslides made rescue efforts challenging four days after the earthquake. Snowy weather conditions also affected rescue efforts, with snowfall reaching 10cm (3.9in) in several areas and raising concerns of additional building collapses. Snowfall significantly affected rescuers' ability to deliver supplies to isolated villages and recover survivors. Power was also cut due to snow, disabling cell phones.\nBy 3 January, about 31,800 people were living in shelters following the earthquake, with about 27,700 sheltering in 336 evacuation centers in Ishikawa prefecture alone. Following reports of deaths at evacuation centers, several vulnerable evacuees were evacuated to other prefectures, with at least 30 people being transferred to medical facilities in Aichi Prefecture. The government said it had secured about 6,500 public housing units for evacuees to resettle across the country. The construction of temporary housing began on 12 January with 115 home units in Wajima and Suzu. Sixty units in Noto and Anamizu were also scheduled for construction on 15 January. A month after the earthquake, around 14,000 people remained displaced due to the disaster and about 2,867 people continued to live in damaged homes.\nLocal authorities announced plans to transfer students from schools in Wajima that had been converted to evacuation centers to schools in Hakusan and Kanazawa, followed by around 140 junior high school students from Suzu and Noto. Fifty students from a high school in Wajima were transferred to Kai, Yamanashi prefecture, with 600 others expected to arrive in April. Schools in some of the affected areas resumed on 15 January, along with garbage-collection services in Wajima. At least 44 schools in the affected areas remain closed as of 22 January but gradually reopened, with the remaining seven schools reopening in Wajima on 6 February. Applicants from Ishikawa Prefecture who were unable to take the Common Test for University Admissions held on 13\u201314 January due to the earthquake were allowed to undertake makeup examinations scheduled later in the month.\nOn 14 January, Kishida made his first visit to the disaster zone, where he held an aerial inspection over Ishikawa Prefecture and visited evacuation centers in Wajima and Suzu. On 25 January, the Japanese government unveiled a disaster recovery package in which residents were exempted from the cost of demolishing their homes and would receive around $20,000 to rebuild destroyed or severely damaged houses. It also called for the construction of wooden and conventional makeshift prefabricated dwellings. The government also pledged to shoulder up to 75 percent of costs in resuming operations at small and midsized businesses, with a limit of $10 million. It also pledged to support the replacement of affected agricultural machinery and fishing boats, as well as the recovery of traditional industries in the area such as Wajima-nuri lacquerware. The government also said it was planning to shoulder half the hotel fees for tourists in the Hokuriku Region with a limit of $135 per stay to promote tourism. The government said the package would be funded by the national budget's reserve funds in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years.\nKansai Electric Power Company, Tokyo Electric Power Company and Hokuriku Electric Power Company said they were inspecting their nuclear power plants for abnormalities. Both the Kansai and Hokuriku Electric Power Companies initially said no abnormalities were reported, with the reactors at the latter's Shika Nuclear Power Plant in Ishikawa Prefecture having been closed for inspections at the time of the earthquake. However, a cumulative oil spillage of 19,800 liters at two of the reactors was later revealed, partially impacting the plant's ability to receive power from external sources. Hokuriku Electric Power Company subsequently said that repairs at the facility would take more than six months. Eighteen of the Shika nuclear plant's 116 radiation monitoring posts were also rendered offline by the earthquake.\nThe Japanese Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) also found no irregularities in power plants along the Sea of Japan coastline, but ordered Hokuriku Electric Power Company to conduct further study of the earthquake's impact on the Shika Nuclear Power Plant. Hokuriku Electric Power Company also shut down two generators at its Nanao Ota thermal power plant in Nanao.\nBy 29 January, electricity had been restored to 80 percent of households in Wajima and Suzu, and 99 percent in Nanao, Noto, Anamizu and Shika. Ishikawa's governor Hiroshi Hase said power was expected to be fully restored in the prefecture by 31 January.\nConcerns over the safety of the Shika nuclear power plant and nearby nuclear facilities led to residents living near the power plants to submit a petition to the NRA on 2 February asking for a suspension in the screening process undertaken prior to reopening the Shika power plant until damage at the facility is fully examined and safety measures are implemented.\nShinkansen services were suspended in central and eastern parts of Japan following the earthquake, stranding at least 1,400 passengers aboard four stalled trains between Toyama and Kanazawa for about 11 hours. Local train services were also halted for up to 24 hours following the earthquake, stranding about 1,000 passengers aboard express trains. Shinkansen services resumed in the afternoon of 2 January. Several major highways in the affected areas were also closed. All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines cancelled flights to Toyama, Ishikawa, and Niigata prefectures for the rest of 1 January. Japan Airlines subsequently announced additional flights to Komatsu Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture and Niigata Airport on 2 January.\nBy the morning of 3 January, Japan Railways partially resumed services, however, some local lines remained suspended, including the Nanao Line and the Noto Railway. The MLIT confirmed that Noto Airport would remain closed until 4 January. Following repairs, the airport reopened to JSDF aircraft on 11 January, while All Nippon Airways resumed commercial services to and from the airport on 27 January, albeit in a limited capacity until the end of February.\nDue to blocked roads, humanitarian aid was sent to the peninsula using ships, while other isolated areas were accessed through helicopters. In light of the difficulties in providing aid, Ishikawa Prefecture asked individuals to refrain from sending aid, instead limiting the call to corporations only. By 4 January, authorities had delivered about 240,000 meals, 500 packages of powdered milk, and 190,000 bottles of drinking water to the affected areas.\nOn the evening of 2 January, a collision occurred at Haneda Airport in Tokyo between a Japan Coast Guard DHC-8 aircraft carrying humanitarian aid to earthquake victims in Niigata and Japan Airlines Flight 516, an A350-900 from New Chitose Airport landing at Haneda, destroying both aircraft. All 379 people aboard the JAL plane were evacuated; however, 15 sustained injuries. The captain of the Coast Guard plane escaped with critical injuries, while the remaining five crew members were killed.\nFundraising campaigns across the country collected a total amount of \u00a510 billion ($67 million) for relief aid. Private organizations raised at least $8 million in crowdfunding drives for relief aid, while the Ishikawa prefectural government began accepting cash donations at its offices, including those in Tokyo and Osaka, while announcing plans to open a bank account for further donations. By 24 January, the prefectural government said that it had received a total of at least 11 billion yen ($74.4 million) in donations, which was augmented by donations amounting to $8.1 million for the local Japanese Red Cross Society (JRCS) and $2.4 million to the local Central Community Chest of Japan (CCCJ) branch. The Central Community Chest of Japan also established the Disaster Relief Volunteer & NPO Support Fund (VolSup) to support NPOs and their activities in providing help to victims.\nApparel companies, including Gunze, Fast Retailing and Onward Holdings, donated at least 170,000 items for victims of the earthquake. About 110 hotels and inns volunteered to take in 3,000 people displaced by the earthquake. JR Freight announced that it would carry humanitarian aid to the affected areas for free. Nintendo announced that it will donate \u00a550 million via the JRCS for disaster relief, with The Pok\u00e9mon Company also having donated the same amount earlier in the month. KDDI offered 550 Starlink routers to shelters, government offices and medical teams operating in areas affected by the earthquake. In February 2024, the Japan Sumo Association donated \u00a510 million to Ishikawa Prefecture, plus \u00a55 million collected from spectators at the January tournament in Tokyo.\nThe JRCS dispatched staff members and Emergency Medical Relief Teams to Ishikawa prefecture, focusing on hospitals, social welfare facilities, and evacuation centers. It also deployed Disaster Medical Coordination teams, nurses, and provided psychosocial support to affected people. The JRCS also installed a temporary water distribution system at evacuation centers in Nanao, which began supplying water on 22 January by purifying water from a swimming pool.\nThe Taiwanese government announced \u00a560 million in aid to support rescue operations and relief. A donation account was also created, while a fundraising campaign collected over NT$540 million ($17.2 million) from the private sector. United States Ambassador Rahm Emmanuel pledged an initial $100,000 in humanitarian aid to Japan and logistical support from the United States military. Japan said it only had plans to accept aid from the United States despite offers from other countries including Taiwan and China. In a statement from Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the country was \"not accepting any personnel or material aid at the moment given the situation on the ground and the efforts that would be required to receive them.\" South Korea also said that it would provide $3 million worth of humanitarian aid. The Thai embassy in Tokyo sent 2,500 kilograms worth of food and other relief items to Ishikawa Prefecture.\nLos Angeles Dodgers baseball player Shohei Ohtani donated an undisclosed amount of aid to victims in the Noto peninsula. The Dodgers subsequently announced that it would donate an additional $1 million towards earthquake relief.\nThe Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Centre (PBV) and Peace Wing launched initiatives to support the affected regions, with PBV providing food and material supplies, first-aid, and support for shelter operations and disaster relief volunteer centers, while Peace Wing dispatched an emergency support team, including doctors, nurses, rescue workers, and a disaster relief dog team, to provide search and rescue support, medical support, and emergency supplies.\nThe aftermath of the earthquake included a major humanitarian impact in the worst affected regions, as well as a national economic impact. Preliminary findings by Japanese financial services company Nomura Securities suggested the temporary stagnation of economic activity would push down nominal GDP by 23 to 50 billion yen. Nomura estimated that the most affected cities, such as Suzu, Wajima and Nanao, will experience a temporary pause in economic activity. NHK added that losses are likely to increase, as the damage to roads, housing and factories has not been considered in the research. However, it is estimated that the wider impact on supply chains may be less than those compared to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes. Tourism in the affected areas suffered negatively, with 10,000 people cancelling their bookings in Toyama Prefecture alone, leading to losses of about 140 million yen ($970,000).\nAs of 5 January, approximately 24,000 buildings remained without electricity in Ishikawa prefecture, and the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ken Sait\u014d, told reporters of the difficulty of estimating a clear timeframe for the recovery of power. Two whale sharks at the Notojima Aquarium died nine days after the earthquake. Park officials said damaged equipment may have deteriorated living conditions inside the tank and contributed to their deaths.\nAt least 32 criminal incidents relating to the earthquake were reported following the disaster, including burglaries of damaged or evacuated homes and thefts at evacuation centers. The police pledged to install about 1,000 security cameras in the affected areas in response to these incidents.\nThe perceived slow response drew widespread criticism from the public. Anger was directed at Kishida for his delayed deployment of the JSDF. He was also criticized for only visiting an evacuation center briefly two weeks after the earthquake. In Wajima, there were over 4,000 registrations for temporary housing units with baths and water heating, of which, only 550 were constructed by mid-February. Only 40 of the 456 temporary housing units in Suzu were completed. Local officials said about 14,000 temporary housing units would be ready by the end of March. Despite reassurance by the government, local residents' confidence remains low due to living conditions in evacuation centers and the delayed response. By the end of February, more than 11,000 people remained in temporary shelters.\nThe earthquake also led to a weakening of the Japanese yen, in contrast to its temporary appreciation against the dollar following previous earthquakes.\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako's annual New Year appearance and greetings to the public on 2 January was cancelled due to the earthquake. The Imperial Household Agency said it was the first time that the event was cancelled due to a natural disaster. It also reported that the Imperial couple \"wish that rescue operations and fire-fighting efforts in affected areas will progress as quickly as possible amid the severe cold weather.\" At a function in Tokyo marking his first public appearance for the year on 15 January, the emperor offered his first public condolences for those affected and praised relief workers for their efforts. He also sent a message of sympathy to Ishikawa governor Hiroshi Hase. Ahead of his 64th birthday on 23 February, the emperor reiterated his condolences for the victims and expressed an intent for the Imperial couple to visit the Noto Peninsula once circumstances allow. Prime Minister Kishida also postponed a ceremonial New Year visit to the Ise Shrine due to the earthquake.\nA moment of silence was held for the victims of the earthquake on the first day of trading of 2024 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nToyota delayed the beginning of its domestic vehicle manufacturing operations for 2024, which had been due to begin on 8 January, until further notice, citing earthquake damage to some of its suppliers.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, his condolences and wished the Japanese people a fast recovery. It marked the first time Kim has sent his condolences after a natural disaster, and the first time he has sent a telegram to Kishida. It was also the first time that North Korea had sent official condolences to Japan since 1995. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sent condolences and said Australia was ready to send any assistance to Japan. Philippine president Bongbong Marcos offered to send assistance to Japan, while the Armed Forces of the Philippines also offered to collaborate with the JSDF in its response to the earthquake. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and Pope Francis also expressed their prayers to the victims of the earthquake. The United States announced preparations for military logistics, food and aid. United States Forces Japan remained \"ready to support our Japanese Allies during this difficult time.\"\nIn China, a news anchor from Hainan Radio and Television was suspended after stating on his Weibo account that the earthquake was retribution over the Japanese government's decision to discharge radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean which started in September 2023.\nMisinformation about the earthquake spread on social media platforms such as Twitter. Users falsely linked a November 2023 video of an underwater earthquake in Indonesia, photos of the 2011 T\u014dhoku and 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes and a 2021 landslide following the earthquake. At least one account, claiming to belong to a victim of the earthquake, was found to be using misinformation to seek donations online. False claims were also made of the earthquake being man-made, with a video citing a previous nuclear weapons test by North Korea. Analysis conducted by NHK found that many sources of misinformation regarding false requests for rescue appeared to have originated from overseas-based accounts, especially in Pakistan.\nFormer Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama incorrectly claimed the earthquake caused a fire at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant and suggested that impacts of the earthquake had been deliberately downplayed to restart the plant. While there had been a minimal oil spill at two of the reactors, there was no impact on the plant.",

        "title": "2024 Chile wildfires",
        "text": "In February 2024, a series of wildfires broke out in Chile, affecting multiple regions including Valpara\u00edso, O'Higgins, Maule, Biob\u00edo, and Los Lagos. The most severe incidents occurred in the Valpara\u00edso Region as of 5 February 2024. The Chilean government labeled the fires as the country's worst disaster since the 2010 Chile earthquake, and declared a two-day national mourning period.\nDeputy Interior Minister Manuel Monsalve reported on 4 February that there were 162 forest fires across central and southern Chile. The region experienced unusually high temperatures, reaching up to 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in the past week, worsened by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and a \"mega-drought\" that has affected the country over the last decade. Over 43,000 hectares of land were affected. As of 4 February, authorities had managed to bring 43 fires under control, while 34 were still being dealt with.\nPresident Gabriel Boric suggested that some fires might have been intentionally started, a view supported by Valpara\u00edso Region Governor Rodrigo Mundaca.\nIn January 2024, two forest fires prompted the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response (SENAPRED) to issue a red alert. One occurred on 20 January in Lonquimay, Araucan\u00eda Region, and another on 26 January in Puerto Montt, Los Lagos Region.\nOn 22 January, a fire, named \"Antiquereo 2\", broke out on the boundary of Portezuelo and Trehuaco in the \u00d1uble Region. It was contained by 24 January after consuming 35 hectares (86 acres). SENAPRED responded by declaring a yellow alert in Portezuelo, marking the first alert of the year in the region.\nBy the end of January 2024, a fire originating in Florida, Biob\u00edo Region, spread to Quill\u00f3n in the \u00d1uble Region. The \"Casablanca\" fire, covering 69.5 hectares (172 acres) in the Pe\u00f1ablanca sector, was extinguished through collaborative efforts between the Quill\u00f3n and Florida fire departments.\nIn the last week of January 2024, a heatwave hit central Chile, with temperatures 10 to 15 \u00b0C (18 to 27 \u00b0F) above the weekly average. Anticipating an increased wildfire risk, the Meteorological Directorate of Chile issued a heat alert on 28 January, projecting temperatures of 36 to 38\u00b0C (97 to 100\u00b0F) in valleys and foothills of the central zone and 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) on the coast of Valpara\u00edso, O'Higgins, and Maule regions.\nThousands of people in the Valpara\u00edso Region, which have had the deadliest wildfires, were urged to evacuate by the authorities.\nAt 3:25 on 2 February, a red alert was declared in Valpara\u00edso Province due to a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) fire that affected the Las Docas road, south of Valpara\u00edso. An hour later, it was announced that the fire affected 5 hectares (12 acres) of land. At 3:10 p.m., another set of fires was reported in the Lago Pe\u00f1uelas National Reserve, affecting 30 hectares (74 acres). The fire was described as one of \"rapid advance and high intensity\", and caused the interruption of vehicular traffic on Routes 68 and F-718. Another fire was reported in Lo Moscoso at 3:54 p.m., affecting 8 hectares (20 acres) in the communes of Quilpu\u00e9 and Villa Alemana. At the same time, authorities placed the Marga Marga province on red alert.\nSENAPRED reported that the Lo Moscoso fire extended to 80 hectares (200 acres) at 5:15 p.m., and ordered the evacuation of the Quebrada Escobares and Fundo El Rinc\u00f3n sectors of Villa Alemana. By then, the fire in the Lago Pe\u00f1uelas Reserve had affected 480 hectares (1,200 acres). By 9:00 p.m., Los Andes, Petorca, Quillota, San Antonio and San Felipe de Aconcagua provinces were also placed on red alert. By 10:00 p.m. more than 6,200 hectares (15,000 acres) of land had been affected by the fires.\nOn 31 January, authorities declared a Yellow Alert in response to active fires, including the \"Mait\u00e9n\" fire in Navidad commune, which threatened homes and critical infrastructure, and the \"La Aguada\" fire in La Estrella commune. At 6:00 p.m., evacuations were ordered in La Patag\u00fcilla, La Aguada, El Mait\u00e9n, and San Rafael. On 2 February, Senapred called for urgent evacuation from San Miguel de Viluco and Pihuelo.\nBy 2 February, the situation escalated significantly, leading Senapred to declare a Red Alert for the entire region, indicating greater severity of the fires and the need to mobilize all available resources for their suppression. Due to the severity of the forest fire in La Estrella, Senapred ordered the evacuation of the La Puntilla sector. At 2:00 p.m., evacuation orders were extended to other sectors of the commune. At 6:00 p.m., the evacuation of Pumanque commune was ordered. At 7:00 p.m., other sectors of La Estrella were ordered evacuated. By 6:00 p.m., it was reported that 3,455 hectares (8,540 acres) had been destroyed by the fires.\nOn 1 February, authorities issued a Yellow Alert for the communes of Pencahue and Curepto. This measure was taken in response to the \"Hijuela 3 Las Palmas\" fire, which at that time affected 650 hectares (1,600 acres) and represented an immediate threat to critical infrastructure, such as telecommunications antennas.\nThe situation quickly escalated, leading to an alert update on 2 February, forcing Senapred to declare a Red Alert for Curepto, Pencahue and Sagrada Familia. This decision was driven by the expansion of the \"Hijuela 3 Las Palmas\" fire to 850 hectares (2,100 acres) and its extreme behavior, which included the emission of sparks and proximity to populated areas, which represented a significant risk for local communities. During the same day, in response to the \"Santa Laura\" forest fire in the commune of Curic\u00f3 reported at 5:54 p.m. and which initially covered 5 hectares (12 acres), Senapred declared a Yellow Alert for the commune. At 5:00 p.m, sectors of Curic\u00f3 were ordered to evacuate. At 19:19, in response to the growth of the fire to 20 hectares (49 acres), the Yellow Alert was upgraded to a Red Alert. This led to the mobilization all available resources for its control, including the additional deployment of CONAF brigades, aircraft and the participation of the Carabineros de Chile to assist in the evacuation of the affected areas. At 10:39 p.m., the \"Santa Laura\" fire was declared \"controlled\" after affecting 30 hectares (74 acres), and prompted the downgrading of the Red Alert to Yellow by Senapred and CONAF, indicating that, although the immediate threat had been overcome, resources would remain on alert to respond to any change in conditions.\nAt 10:50 p.m., a red alert was declared in the commune of Huala\u00f1\u00e9, affecting 120 hectares (300 acres). The mobilization of resources in response to the Red Alert was considerable, including the participation of firefighters from several communes (Talca, Huaqu\u00e9n, Pencahue, Maule, San Javier and San Rafael), multiple CONAF brigades and private companies such as Celulosa Arauco, CMPC and Vista Hermosa, as well as the use of planes and helicopters from CONAF and Celulosa Arauco, among other land and technical resources.\nOn 2 February at 2:19, a Red Alert was declared for the commune of Mulch\u00e9n due to the \"Mininco VIII\" forest fire. This fire, which is being fought and has affected approximately 150 hectares (370 acres), is characterized by its proximity to populated areas, extreme fire behavior, including flying sparks and erratic winds. Until that time, a brigade from the CONAF is working at the site. On 3 January at 8:48 p.m., the alert was canceled after the fire was declared under control.\nOn 3 February, authorities declared a Red Alert for the commune of Galvarino in response to the \"Colonia Suiza\" and \"Nilpe 4\" forest fires. The \"Colonia Suiza\" fire affected 15 hectares while the \"Nilpe 4\" fire affected 5 hectares (12 acres).\nOn 26 January, a forest fire began in the Los Lagos Region, which led authorities to declare a Yellow Alert after the \"Camino San Antonio\" fire was detected in Puerto Montt, initially affecting 6 hectares (15 acres). The situation quickly worsened, leading to the declaration of a Red Alert on the same day, at 8:36 p.m., in response to the growth of the fire to 63 hectares (160 acres) and its continued proximity to populated areas. This declaration mobilized an expanded set of resources, including CONAF brigades, firefighters from various locations, helicopters, and specialized machinery, to fight the fire effectively and protect the communities at risk.\nIn the following days, the Red Alert was maintained, reflecting the persistent severity of the fire, which consumed 546 hectares (1,350 acres) and then increased to 804 hectares (1,990 acres). During this period, preventive evacuations were carried out: on the morning of 28 January, 74 people were evacuated from 19 homes in the affected sectors, who returned to their homes in the afternoon of the same day. In addition, temporary shelters were set up and technical tables were held to coordinate the response to the fire.\nThe operations included the active participation of firefighters, CONAF brigades, technicians, helicopters managed by both CONAF and Senapred, and the use of highway machinery and private resources. The joint effort between different entities allowed the fire to be fought with a combination of ground and air strategies, including the use of Hercules C-130 aircraft for extinguishing operations. In addition, attention was paid to the safety of brigade members and the well-being of those affected by the fire, with the implementation of evacuation measures and the provision of temporary accommodation for those displaced from their homes.\nA total of 131 people were killed in the fires, of whom 35 have been identified so far. The Chilean Forensic Medical Service said many bodies were found to be in bad condition and difficult to identify, prompting them to take DNA samples from people with missing relatives. At least 45 of the dead were found at the scene, while six others died of burn injuries in medical facilities. At least 14,000 houses were affected by the fires in Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Quilpu\u00e9. Over 370 people were reported missing in the Vi\u00f1a del Mar area alone, while 1,600 others were displaced by the fires. The fires were regarded as the deadliest in Chile's history, and the deadliest disaster in the country since the 2010 Chile earthquake.\nIn Valpara\u00edso, four hospitals and three nursing homes were evacuated, and two bus terminals were destroyed. In Vi\u00f1a del Mar, the city's botanical garden, which was founded in 1931, was destroyed by the fires, killing an employee and three of her relatives.\nPresident Gabriel Boric said the death toll was likely to rise.\nThe fires have prompted the deployment of 31 firefighting aircraft and 1,400 firefighters, along with 1,300 military personnel, to aid in the emergency response. President Gabriel Boric ordered the deployment of more military units to help tackle the fires and urged citizens to cooperate with emergency teams. Additionally, a curfew was implemented in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Limache, Quilpu\u00e9, and Villa Alemana beginning at 09:00 pm on 3 February to facilitate the movement of emergency vehicles. Authorities ordered a ban on handling fire and other heat-producing machines in Valpara\u00edso and Marga Marga provinces.\nA state of emergency was declared on 3 February, while Boric declared two days of national mourning. On 3 February, Boric went in a flyover over the affected areas before visiting a school that had been converted into a shelter for those displaced by the fires. He also ordered the conversion of the official presidential summer residence, the Palace of Cerro Castillo, in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, into a temporary leisure center for affected children and the donation of furniture that had been used in the 2023 Pan American Games, as well as the forgiveness of the water bills of 9,200 households.\nThe health ministry issued a health alert over the Valparaiso Region and ordered the suspension of elective surgeries. It also authorized the establishment of field hospitals and announced the hiring of medical students nearing the end of their studies to augment medical responders.\nThe Vi\u00f1a del Mar Festival canceled its opening gala in mourning for the victims. Some participants such as Alejandro Sanz, Pablo Albor\u00e1n and Man\u00e1 sent messages of solidarity and announced donations.\nThe government of Mexico sent a team of 30 firefighters from the National Forestry Commission and 127 Army and Air Force personnel, together with 26 tons of food supplies. US President Joe Biden said that Washington \"is in contact with our Chilean partners\" and \"is ready to provide necessary assistance to the Chilean people\". Pope Francis called for prayers for the \"dead and wounded in the devastating fires in Chile\". The United Nations offered condolences and announced assistance.",

        "text": "Coverage on this live blog has ended. Please follow our latest updates here.\nSatellite images captured the devastation on Maui Wednesday after a wildfire tore through Lahaina, a popular vacation destination on the island\u2019s west coast that was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\nIn one image from the company Maxar Technologies, the historic area of Banyan Court \u2014 home to the island\u2019s oldest living banyan tree, at 150 years old \u2014 appears to have mostly been reduced to ash.\nOther images showed similar devastation in and around Lahaina Square, a shopping area, and a neighborhood on the southern end of the town.\nVisitors \u201cwith vehicles or any means of transportation\u201d are being asked to leave the fire-ravaged Lahaina area and Maui as soon as possible, county officials said today.\nThe county made the request because officials have limited resources in what it described as a crisis.\nBuses will be taking people from Sheraton Maui Resort in Ka\u02bbanapali to Kahului Airport, the county said.\nWidespread damage has been seen in Lahaina in western Maui from one of three wildfires. At least six people are dead, and western Maui does not have power or cell service.\nMore than 100 Maui firefighters were battling three wildfires today, and helicopters have been making water drops and conducting searches, Maui County said.\nNo new evacuations were ordered in Maui, which has faced severe wind-fueled wildfires, but the damage in the western Maui town of Lahaina was called widespread.\nThere are three fires on Maui \u2014 the Lahaina, P\u016blehu and Upcountry fires. The National Guard and other military units are assisting with helicopters doing water drops, officials said.\nFirefighters in Lahaina were putting out spot fires around the community of around 12,700, the county said in a statement.\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell also tweeted that she has spoken with the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, and that the agency has authorized federal assistance to help firefighting efforts.\nResidents who have fled their homes in advance of devastating wildfires have shared their heartbreak and uncertainty with NBC affiliate KHNL of Honolulu.\n\u201cEveryone I know in Lahaina, their homes have been burned down,\u201d Tiare Lawrence, of the community on the western edge of Maui, told the station. She said she was trying to make sure everyone in her family is safe.\nHolly Zackious, of Kula, found her home was intact but told the station that others in the neighborhood were burned to the ground.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful the amount of damage that this fire wreaked havoc,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re praying for Lahaina.\u201d\nGabe Johnson, Maui County council member for the island of L\u0101na\u2019i, told KHNL that those who have not been affected are coming to help others.\n\u201cWe rebuild. You know, Lahaina strong,\u201d Johnson told the station. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an expression.\u201d\nAt least 271 structures have been damaged, destroyed or otherwise impacted in the western Maui town of Lahaina after a devastating wildfire, Maui County officials said.\nThe state\u2019s lieutenant governor said earlier today that it could be weeks or months before the full damage of the fires on Maui is known.\nFires continue to burn both on Maui and the island of Hawaii and high-speed and erratic winds continue to make it difficult to fly aircraft to get a better sense of the totality of the damage, a Hawaii Emergency Management Agency official said.\n\"Widespread damage to the West Maui town, the harbor and surrounding areas are being documented,\" the county said in a statement.\nA historic seaside town that once was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii has been largely reduced to ash as wildfires continued to rip through the state Wednesday.\nHawaiians say Lahaina\u2019s disaster leaves them mourning the loss of a place dense with Native Hawaiian history and culture \u2014 and they\u2019re bracing for what the tragedy will mean for their communities in the long term.\n\u201cPeople are worried about their loved ones, their homes, their businesses, their jobs,\u201d said David Aiona Chang, who is Native Hawaiian and a professor of history at the University of Minnesota. \u201cSo many of the disasters that hit Hawaii hit Native Hawaiians the hardest. It\u2019s something that we are going to be dealing with for a long time.\u201d\nHelicopter video from Air Maui Helicopter Tours in Lahaina shows the devastation in the community of around 12,700 on the western coast of Maui, after wildfires.\nTwo of five people being cared for at Maui Memorial Medical Center following wildfires on the island were in critical condition, Maui Health said today.\nThe hospital is treating five people in all, and seven others have been sent to Oahu for specialty services, some of whom suffered fire-related injuries, Maui Health, a nonprofit hospital organization, said.\nTwo new brushfires started today on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, where fires have also been burning, officials said.\nHawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth has said the focus should be on Maui, where devastating wildfires have occurred, causing at least six deaths.\nThe new fires were in the Ka\u02bb\u016b region, and one of those was under control, the Hawaii Fire Department said.\nThe Akoni Pule Highway brushfire is about 60% contained but is threatening structures, according to the Fire Department, and there are fires in the Mauna Kea Beach area. People at the Mauna Kea Resort have been told to shelter in place.\nRoth in a video briefing earlier today thanked assistance from state agencies and the National Guard in dealing with brushfires on the island.\nIt\u2019s expected to take weeks before officials know the full scale of the damage to Maui in the wake of wildfires, Hawaii\u2019s lieutenant governor said today.\n\u201cThis is not going to be a short journey. It\u2019s going to take weeks and maybe months to assess the full damage,\u201d Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke, who is acting governor until the governor returns early from a trip, said.\nShe said the state will provide whatever assistance possible, and federal aid was also sent or being sent to help in the wildfires and the aftermath.\n\u201cWe will rebuild,\u201d Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said at a news briefing.\nTwo UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters with water buckets, as well as three CH-47 Chinook with 2,000 gallon water buckets, have been or were being sent to Maui today to help, said Maj. Gen. Kenneth S. Hara, adjutant general for the state.\nAlso sent with one of the Chinooks is an \u201cenhanced emergency response force package,\u201d which involves a specialized team capable of confined space search and rescue, he said.\nHigh winds from passing Hurricane Dora may have helped fuel wildfires in Maui, and today the National Weather Service said gusts on the island have reached as high as 67 mph.\nIn the 48 hour period between 10 a.m. Honolulu time Monday and Wednesday morning, the highest recorded gusts were between 45 and 67 mph, according to the weather service.\nForecasters had warned of fire risk due to high winds starting Monday, and a \u201cred flag\u201d warning about fires had also been issued.\nPresident Joe Biden and the first lady today expressed their condolences to the people of Maui, and Biden pledged assistance from federal assets.\n\u201cJill and I send our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones in the wildfires in Maui, and our prayers are with those who have seen their homes, businesses, and communities destroyed,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful to the brave firefighters and first responders who continue to run toward danger, putting themselves in harm\u2019s way to save lives.\u201d\nBiden said he has \u201cordered all available Federal assets on the Islands to help with response.\u201d The Hawaii National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard and the Navy\u2019s Third Fleet is assisting, he said.\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green said that the state will be submitting a request for a presidential disaster declaration once officials know the scope of the devastation. Such declarations allow increased federal aid.\nCliff Alakai, an administrator at Maui Medical Group, said he learned  on Facebook that the group's Lahaina urgent care facility was damaged.\n\"One of our IT people found a picture and put a circle around our clinic. It\u2019s a two-story clinic. It looks like the second floor is heavily damaged,\" Alakai said.\nAlakai said Maui Medical Group operates four additional outpatient clinics outside Lahaina that are open to patients, but many Lahaina residents are hesitant to leave the area because road closures would prevent them from returning home, he said. Employees who live in Lahaina have called out of work, but so far appear to be safe, he added.\n\u201cOur employees who live out there are calling to say, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re all right. Our house burned down, but we\u2019re fine. We got out in time,\u2019\u201d Alakai said.\nJustin Prouty, owner of Minit Medical Urgent Care, said he assumes his Lahaina facility is no longer standing.\n\"All reports coming out of Lahaina are super sketchy right now. There\u2019s just no news there, no cell service so nobody can get any information. It sounds like a couple of our employees have lost their homes,\" Prouty said. \"I\u2019ve had reports that places around our clinic are burned to the ground, so my guess is our clinic is too.\"\nWith wildfires raging, Hawaii officials urged both residents and tourists to avoid all nonessential travel to Maui.\nThere were at least 2,000 people at the airport overnight either attempting to leave or waiting for new flights to come in, according to Hawaii Department of Transportation Director Ed Sniffen.\n\"We made sure that we process them through this morning. We were working with our airline partners on all of that,\" Sniffen said. \"There's another 4,000 visitors that we're expecting who want to leave the island from the west side.\"\nSniffen also noted that traffic on the highways will be congested as people are evacuated and certain areas of the island remain inaccessible.\nActing Gov. Luke also discouraged tourism to Maui as authorities struggle to contain the wildfires.\n\"This is not a safe place to be in certain parts of Maui,\" Luke said. \"We have shelters that are overrun. We have resources that are being taxed.\"\nThe Kula Fire has not been contained on Maui, but officials are hopeful that the situation will improve now that firefighters can deploy water overhead.\n\"I think a big thing that was hampering us yesterday is because of the high winds, we were not able to get helicopters in the air,\" Mayor Richard T. Bissen Jr. said. \"It was not safe for them to do water drops. Apparently as of this morning that situation has improved.\"\nAlmost 100 firefighters have been working in shifts, including 11 who work for the state airport firefighting and rescue teams. Maui first responders were also offered assets from other local and federal partners.\nThe military has provided Black Hawk helicopters and a Chinook helicopter in addition to aircraft from the Hawaii National Guard, according to Maj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, speaking on behalf of the Department of Defense.\nMaui officials say that it's \"impossible\" at this point to quantify the structural damage from the deadly fires.\n\"Our main focus right now is to save lives and preserve lives,\" Mayor Richard T. Bissen Jr. said.\nAt least six people have died in the wildfires, and search-and-rescue efforts continue, Mayor Richard T. Bissen Jr. said.\nBissen said he's unsure of how that number might change as authorities continue to battle the flames.\n\"There were a lot of people putting things out on social media; we have not had a chance to yet to confirm any of that,\" he said. \"We are still in that phase of gathering information.\"\nHawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said no fatalities had been confirmed in his county.\nSeveral burn patients from Maui were being treated at Straub Medical Center, the hospital said in a statement. The facility has the only specialized burn unit in Hawaii.\nThe Honolulu Emergency Services Department transported one woman in her 60s from Maui to the burn center, agency spokesperson Shayne Enright said. The woman was in critical condition.\nThe department has also received reports of multiple patients being flown from Maui to Honolulu, she said.\nMaui's water department is asking consumers across the island to conserve water to reduce demand and extend existing supplies.\n\"The Department of Water Supply urges all residents and visitors to please be mindful of their water use and especially reduce outdoor water use,\" it said in a statement. \"The Water Department is working diligently to ensure our resources are used as efficiently as possible and we need the community to do their part.\"\nCustomers are asked to not wash cars, sidewalks or driveways, or irrigate lawns until further notice.\nGreen said Wednesday he anticipates there will be casualties as a result of the wind-fueled wildfires scorching the islands.\n\u201cHeroic efforts by first responders have prevented many casualties from occurring, but some loss of life is expected,\u201d he said in a statement.\nGreen called the severe weather a \u201cterrible disaster,\u201d noting the wildfires have \u201cspread widely\u201d because of Dora's winds and the region already had underlying drought conditions.\n\u201cMuch of L\u0101hain\u0101 on Maui has been destroyed and hundreds of local families have been displaced,\u201d he said.\nGreen said he anticipates submitting a request for a presidential disaster declaration in the next 36 to 48 hours once the damage extent is assessed.\nHe had been on personal travel until Aug. 15 but will return to the islands Wednesday night to respond to the crisis.\nHawaii state officials will host a briefing on the wildfires and the impact of Dora at 10 a.m. local time (4 p.m. ET) Wednesday.\nLuke, who is serving as acting governor because Green is traveling, will speak, along with the Hawaii County and Maui County mayors.\nLuke issued an emergency proclamation Wednesday to extend the state of emergency to all counties and to discourage \u201cnon-essential air travel to Maui.\u201d\nThe proclamation cited ongoing wildfires in Hawaii, fanned by Dora's winds.\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented disaster as an indirect result of Hurricane Dora passing just south of our islands,\u201d Luke said. \u201cIt is truly devastating and my heart goes out to the residents of Maui and all those impacted.\u201d\nThe proclamation discouraging travel will allow the state to \u201cprioritize our scarce resources for Maui residents who desperately need assistance,\" she  said.\nUnder the proclamation, visitors to West Maui are encouraged to depart the island as soon and as safely as possible.\nWednesday's announcement follows Tuesday\u2019s initial emergency proclamation authorizing the activation of the National Guard and authorizing state general revenue funds to be used for relief.\nIt may be days or weeks before the full extent of damage from the wildfires in Hawaii is known, but the blazes add to what has already been a devastating year of weather and climate disasters.\nA report released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that there were more billion-dollar disasters in the first seven months of 2023 than in any year since 1980, when the agency began tracking these events.\nScientists at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information said there have been 15 extreme weather events so far this year that each caused at least $1 billion in damage. These included severe storms, tornado outbreaks, hail, one flooding event and one winter storm.\nNOAA said these climate and weather disasters caused 113 direct and indirect fatalities and resulted in more than $39.7 billion in damage from January through July.\nHawaiian Airlines tweeted early Wednesday that it will allow passengers to get refunds or change their travel dates because of ongoing wildfires.\nThe airline cited the emergency order in Maui County and the fact that \u201cnon-essential travel is being strongly discouraged.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a travel waiver in place and will allow you to receive a refund or change travel to a future date without penalty,\" the airline said.\nKihei, a census-designated area, is \u201cclear\u201d and residents can return home, Maui County said in an update at 6 a.m. local time (12 p.m. ET).\nOfficials also said residents on Ohukai Road can return home, adding the fire in that area is \u201cnot a threat.\u201d\nHowever, Lahaina officers were evacuating residents in Launiupoko Estates and Punakea Loop.\nTravel in and out of Hawaii has been disrupted because of wildfires burning on several islands, prompting 2,000 travelers from canceled flights and arrivals to shelter at Kahului Airport in Maui County, the county said just before 5 a.m. local time Wednesday.\nSo far Wednesday, there have been 27 delays at the airport and two cancellations, following 45 delays and six cancellations Tuesday, according to FlightAware.com.\nAlmost 100 firefighters have been on duty, including 11 from state airport rescue personnel, the county said.\nMore than 14,000 power outages have been reported across Maui County, according to poweroutage.us, a site that collects and monitors live data from utilities across the United States.\nHawaiian Electric, the largest supplier of electricity in the state, said Tuesday that crews are working on extensive repairs to downed power lines in West Maui and Upcountry, and warned customers to be prepared for extended outages.\n\"With the sustained high wind weather, we are seeing additional impacts to our electrical infrastructure at the same time the crews are making repairs so we are asking customers to please prepare for possible extended outages into the night,\u201d spokesperson Shayna Decker said in a statement Tuesday.\nFires in Hawaii are unlike many of those burning in the U.S. West. They tend to break out in large grasslands on the dry sides of the islands and are generally much smaller than mainland fires.\nFires were rare in Hawaii and on other tropical islands before humans arrived, and native ecosystems evolved without them. This means great environmental damage can occur when fires erupt. For example, fires remove vegetation. When a fire is followed by heavy rainfall, the rain can carry loose soil into the ocean, where it can smother coral reefs.\nA major fire in the Big Island in 2021 burned homes and forced thousands to evacuate.\nThe island of Oahu, where Honolulu is located, also was dealing with power outages, downed power lines and traffic problems, said Adam Weintraub, communication director for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\nAll the Hawaiian islands are under a red flag warning through 6 p.m. local time Wednesday.\nA red flag warning is an alert issued by the weather service when a combination of very low humidity, warm temperatures and strong winds are expected to combine to cause fires to spread rapidly. The warning serves as a signal to officials and fire managers to be on the lookout for potential wildfires in the area.\nThe warning is for leeward areas, meaning land that faces away from the wind usually sheltered by hills and mountains, due to strong winds and low humidity, the agency in Honolulu said in a morning advisory.\n\u201cVery dry fuels combined with strong and gusty easterly winds and low humidities will produce critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon hours,\u201d the advisory said.\nEast winds of 20 to 35 mph with gusts from 40 to 50 mph are forecast, along with humidity levels at 40-45% through the afternoon.\n\u201cAny fires that develops will likely spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not recommended,\u201d the agency warned.\nSchools were shuttered Wednesday due to spreading brush fires and evacuations in Maui.\nClosures in West Maui: Princess Nahi\u2018ena\u2018ena Elementary, King Kamehameha III Elementary, Lahaina Intermediate, Lahainaluna High.\nClosures in South Maui: Kihei Elementary, Lokelani Intermediate, Kamali\u2018i Elementary and K\u016blanih\u0101ko\u2018i High.\nIn Upcountry Maui, King Kekaulike High was closed and in Central Maui, Maui High was being used as an evacuation shelter.\nTwelve people were rescued overnight Tuesday by the Coast Guard after entering the ocean to escape blazes burning in West Maui, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.\n\u201cThe Coast Guard has been responding to impacted areas where residents are entering the ocean due to smoke and fire conditions,\u201d Maui County said in a public notice. \u201cIndividuals were transported by the Coast Guard to safe areas.\u201d\nThe U.S. Coast Guard tweeted that a dozen people were rescued near Lahaina by a 45-foot response boat from the Coast Guard\u2019s Maui Station.\n\"The USCG continues the joint response with federal and state partners while the USCG Cutter Kimball is en route to Maui to enhance efforts,\" it said.\nWildfires continue to burn across Big Island and Maui on Wednesday.\nStrong winds driven by Dora, which has been churning over the central Pacific Ocean and moving west, helped whip up wildfires that spread quickly in Hawaii.\nThe weather service Tuesday warned that 45 mph winds and gusts up to 60 mph could create \"high fire danger with rapid spread.\"\nThe winds strengthened by the hurricane exacerbated multiple fires in Maui and hampered efforts to put the blazes out, the Associated Press reported. Helicopter crews were unable to dump water on the fires to help contain the spread, and downed trees and power lines blocked some road access.\nDora was passing more than 500 miles south of Hawaii, and was not expected to make landfall on the island chain. The Category 4 storm is not thought to be directly responsible for the wildfires, but rather added to dry and windy conditions that heighten the risk of such blazes.\nIn the Kula area of Maui, 80 people were evacuated from 40 homes, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said Tuesday.\nHe said at least two homes were destroyed in a fire that engulfed about 1,100 acres.\nHe noted that fierce winds were the biggest challenge in confronting the blazes, as the wind conditions are unsafe for helicopters to do water drops.\nBig Island Mayor Mitch Roth said that about 400 homes in four communities in the northern part of the island were evacuated Tuesday. He said one roof had caught fire.\nTwo brush fires were burning Tuesday in the Big Island in North and South Kohala, Hawai\u2019i County officials said.\n\u201cA mandatory evacuation was called for in the Kohala Ranch area, and 2 residents have taken shelter at Hisaoka Gymnasium,\u201d the county said in a public notice Tuesday.\nEvacuation shelters were opened at Hisaoka Gym in Kapa\u02bbau and the Waimea Community Center in Waimea, officials said.\nWildfires are also burning in Maui, with the biggest blaze believed to be in Lahaina.\nAn emergency proclamation was issued Tuesday by Lt. Gov Sylvia Luke, activating the Hawaii National Guard.\nEvacuations are underway in Big Island and Maui amid wildfires that are raging across the area, fueled by winds associated with Dora.\nOfficials were not aware of any deaths and knew of only one injury, a firefighter who was in stable condition at a hospital after experiencing smoke inhalation, Maui County spokesperson Mahina Martin said in a phone interview early Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s no count available for the number of structures affected by the fires or the number of people affected by evacuations, but she said there are four shelters open, with more than 1,000 people at the largest.\n\u201cThis is so unprecedented,\u201d she said, noting that multiple districts were affected. An emergency in the night is terrifying, she said, and the darkness makes it hard to gauge the extent of the damage.\nSeveral transportation services were disrupted Wednesday due to wildfires burning in Maui.\nThe Lahaina Islander Route #20, Lahaina Villager Route #23, Kaanapali Islander Route #25, and West Maui Islander Route #28 were suspended until further notice, the county said in a public notice.\nMaui Bus ADA Paratransit Service and MEO Human Service Transportation trips to and from and within West Maui were also suspended.\n\u201cAll Maui Bus Commuter Services will be suspended until further notice,\u201d the county said.\nFirst responders faced a hurdle in grappling with wildfires burning in Maui as 911 service went down early Wednesday.\nMaui County said on social media the service was unavailable in the island\u2019s west side at 12 a.m. local time (6 a.m. ET).\nLocals are urged to call the Lahaina Police Department directly in case of an emergency.",

        "text": "Coverage on this live blog has ended. Please follow our updates here.\nMore of the Maui wildfire that devastated the town of Lahaina was contained Thursday, but as the damage became clearer Hawaii\u2019s governor said the disaster will likely be historic.\n\u201cWhat we saw was likely the largest natural disaster in Hawaii state history,\u201d Gov. Josh Green said. He compared it to the tsunami that struck the Big Island in 1960, killing 61 people.\nThe number of people confirmed dead in the wildfires rose Friday to 55, but officials don\u2019t know how many people died in the fire in and around Lahaina or how many people may still be missing. Recovery of remains is expected to take days and weeks, the governor said.\nThe fire that struck Lahaina was 80% contained Thursday, officials said. None of three fires burning were 100% contained, Maui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said.\nGreen said the damage from the fires was \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d in the billions of dollars.\nOn Thursday, President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration and ordered additional federal aid. Green said that will allow rental assistance and FEMA grants to people, and aid to small businesses.\nAlso Thursday, some airlines sent help. United canceled flights so empty planes could be flown to Maui to help tourists and other visitors leave. Alaska Airlines said it was sending rescue flights. County officials have asked visitors to leave in order to focus on the crisis.\nCalifornia and Nevada said they were sending urban search and rescue teams, including dogs.\nThe death toll as it is currently known makes it one of the deadliest wildfires in American history.\nThe Camp Fire in California that devastated the town of Paradise in 2018 killed 85 people. That fire has been called the deadliest wildfire in U.S. history in the previous 100 years. It was the deadliest and most destructive in California state history, according to state officials.\nThe number of people confirmed to have died in the devastating Maui fire is now 55, local officials said early Friday.\n\"As firefighting efforts continue, 2 additional fatalities have been confirmed today amid the active Lahaina fire,\" Maui county said in a news release.\nResidents of Lahaina are mourning the loss of nearly all their cultural institutions. Among them is a 200-year-old church, which Native Hawaiians say has been a mainstay in their community for centuries.\n\u201cIt was a gathering place, it was a staple of Lahaina,\u201d said K\u016bhi\u014d Lewis, the CEO of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement. \u201cLike when you think of Seattle, you think of the Space Needle. In Lahaina, it was that church.\u201d\nWaiola Church has been standing since Lahaina was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii in the 1800s, he said. It just celebrated its 200th anniversary this year. It was the main location of community meetings both in the 1820s and the 2020s, and it was the burial site of early members of the Hawaiian royal family.\nOne of the first marks of Christianity on Maui, it\u2019s now listed as permanently closed on Google Maps.\nWithin two hours of learning about the explosive wildfires in Maui, Dr. Reza Danesh had stocked his mobile medical clinic with antibiotics, food and water. He set out for Lahaina, a community now almost entirely devastated by the flames.\nDanesh said he spent 14 hours Wednesday driving people to evacuation shelters, treating them in his mobile clinic and helping triage evacuees. One woman he treated was covered in small burns. She told him she jumped into the ocean to avoid the flames, along with her neighbors \u2014 one of whom died, she said.\n\u201cI heard that story, and I was just so sad,\u201d Danesh said. \u201cThere she was, keeping her spirits, and her pets had all died, and she had nothing, and I\u2019m taking care of her wounds.\u201d\nProgress has been made in the deadliest of the Maui wildfires that broke out Tuesday, but none were fully contained, and spot fires continued to break out, the Maui County fire chief said.\nThe Lahaina fire, which began Tuesday morning and devastated the town of the same name, was 80% contained today, officials said.\nSeveral fires broke out Tuesday starting shortly after midnight, fueled by high winds, Maui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said. Wind gusts of 60 mph were observed during the Lahaina fire, he said.\n\u201cAdditionally, we\u2019ve had many small fires in between these large fires,\u201d he said at a news conference.\n\"Things are falling every minute around us, and there have been some people hurt by falling telephone poles,\" he said.\nIt will be years before the West Maui town of Lahaina is rebuilt, and so much was damaged that it will be a new community, Green said today.\n\u201cWhen you see full extent of the destruction of Lahaina, it will shock you,\u201d the governor said at a news conference.\nGreen said the damage in Maui due to wind-fueled wildfires will be in the billions of dollars.\n\u201cIt does appear like a bomb and fire went off, if I may. And all of those buildings virtually are going to have to be rebuilt,\u201d he said.\nThe recovery of remains of those killed in a devastating wildfire that struck Lahaina is expected to take days and go into weeks, officials said today as they asked for patience.\nSo far 53 deaths have been confirmed after the fire in the Lahaina town area, Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier said. There are other fires in other parts of Maui.\n\u201cThere will be active recovery over the coming days and weeks of the bones of those who have been lost,\u201d Green said.\n\u201cWe have to respect the fact that we\u2019ve got loved ones in that earth, and we\u2019ve got to do the right thing and get them out the right way. That\u2019s going to take time,\u201d he said.\nOfficials also don\u2019t know exactly how many people are missing, Pelletier said.\nHotels and residents from across Hawaii will be asked to house thousands of people displaced by devastating wildfires that have struck Maui, the governor said.\nState officials will initially seek 2,000 rooms and will ask not only hotels but also residents who have space, like guest houses called ohanas.\n\u201cIf you have additional space in your home, if you have the capacity to take someone in from West Maui, please do,\u201d Green said.\nGreen toured the devastated town of Lahaina and said probably \u201cwell over\u201d 1,000 buildings had been destroyed.\nThe fires that have devastated the town of Lahaina and killed at least 53 people are likely to be the largest natural disaster in Hawaii's history as a state, Gov. Josh Green said today.\nGreen said the scope of the disaster may exceed that of the tsunami that struck the island of Hawaii and killed 61 people in 1960, one year after Hawaii became a state.\nGreen said the damage he saw today in Lahaina was \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\n\"What we saw was the utter devastation of Lahaina,\" he said, adding, \"What we saw was likely the largest natural disaster in Hawaii state history.\"\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green estimated there are probably \u201cwell over 1,000 buildings\u201d destroyed in Maui wildfires that have also killed dozens of people.\n\u201cMany, many hundreds of families have been displaced,\u201d Green said in a video posted to social media after he witnessed some of the devastation in Lahaina.\n\u201cThis is devastating for Maui,\u201d Green said. He said the number of deaths is expected to increase.\nMAUI, Hawaii \u2014 Yesterday, when Bill Thornquest and Martha Roberts got an alert on their phones that a community across the highway was being evacuated, they went outside to take a look.\n\u201cBy the time we tried to get back to our house, we couldn\u2019t. So we just had to keep moving,\u201d Thornquest, 70, said today. \u201cSo we walked ahead of the fire.\u201d\nThey are safe at Maui High School, the largest evacuation center in Maui, and Roberts said she feels blessed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen several friends, so I know they\u2019re still here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe just barely got out,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThere were ashes, embers, everything flying through the air.\u201d\nOne of their neighbors, Mike, texted them the news that their home in Lahaina had been destroyed.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re still here, and Mike\u2019s still here,\u201d Roberts said.\nCHICAGO \u2014 Ryan Tavenner said the first five vacation days in Maui were wonderful, but \"it went from paradise to the complete opposite pretty quick. And then the fires came.\"\n\"It was just surreal, to be honest,\u201d Tavenner said today after he returned to Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport.\nTavenner was one of many tourists who left Maui after the deadly wildfires engulfed Lahaina. Maui officials has asked all visitors to leave because of the crisis.\nThe winds from Hurricane Dora, which passed far to the south, knocked out power, Tavenner said. When the fires started Tuesday, he said, he saw thick black billowing smoke from around a mile away.\nWednesday, there was a knock on the door at 3 a.m., and he and his family were told to evacuate. \u201cHe said go north,\u201d Tavenner said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never witnessed it before, besides on TV \u2014 from it to go from a small brushfire to burning down neighborhoods,\u201d Tavenner said. \"It's heart-wrenching.\"\nCharlie Newman, a student at the University of Chicago, was visiting his parents on Maui. They tried to go to the airport Tuesday afternoon but turned around because of traffic from what they thought was a small contained brushfire, intending to try again yesterday morning.\nThen all cell service went out. Yesterday morning on the highway, there was \u201cjust a mass exodus of people, just inching along the highway, parked on the side of the road,\u201d he said. They eventually drove around Maui on the north road to the airport.\n\"Obviously, there are a lot of people who had just tremendous tragedies, so thoughts and prayers are with them for sure,\" he said.\nThe death toll from the wildfires on Maui has climbed to 53, officials said.\nSeventeen additional deaths were discovered in the wildfire that struck Lahaina, a town of around 12,000 in western Maui, raising the number of confirmed deaths from the previous number of 36, Maui County said.\nLAHAINA, Hawaii \u2014 Patrick Sullivan says he waited too long to leave his home as fires engulfed Lahaina in western Maui.  But as winds reached 40 to 60 mph and smoke made it hard to breathe, he couldn\u2019t wait anymore.\nHe has since returned to find his home, which was about 2,000 square feet, and a guest house called an ohana burned to the ground.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our life right here,\u201d Sullivan said. His home and the homes of his two adult children and three grandchildren were also lost.\nSullivan\u2019s dad moved them from Oregon to Honolulu in 1962, and then the family moved to Maui in 1969. \u201cGrandkids are here, fourth generation. And this happened,\u201d he said.\nFive homes in his neighborhood were destroyed in the fire, which devastated much of Lahaina, a town of around 12,000.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to move forward. It\u2019s going to be positive,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cLahaina will come back \u2014 may be 10 years, but it\u2019ll be back.\"\n\"Right here, it's pretty tough,\" he said. \"But we'll make it.\"\nThe wildfire that devastated Maui's historic seaside town of Lahaina is 80% contained, the county government said today.\nThe Lahaina fire is one of six raging on Maui and the Big Island, but firefighters appear to also be making progress elsewhere on Maui. The county government reported that the Pulehu fire is 70% contained.\nOfficials are assessing the Upcountry fire as they focus on the areas of Olinda and Upper Kula.\n\"State forestry workers were leading the firefighting effort in the Olinda area,\" a release said. \"On the Kula side, the fire is most active in gulches that are difficult to access.\"\nThe catastrophic wildfires in Hawaii were fueled by severe drought conditions and fierce, hurricane-strength winds \u2014 a confluence of extremes amplified by climate change that experts say quickly turned a bad situation into a worst-case scenario.\nThe precise cause of the wildfires is not yet known, emergency officials said yesterday. They were worsened in part by strong easterly trade winds whipped up by Hurricane Dora.\n\u201cOur most disastrous wildfires in U.S. history have been associated with extremely strong wind events,\u201d said Crystal Kolden, a pyrogeographer and associate professor at the University of California, Merced, who once worked as a wildland firefighter.\nBut it was how those strong winds interacted with Maui\u2019s mountainous topography that created such volatile fire conditions in the town of Lahaina, she said.\nMental health services are being expanded through the Maui Community Mental Health Center for wildfire victims, the state Health Department said.\n\u201cThe Maui Community Mental Health Center has been serving the community since 1967 and understands that disasters of this magnitude can affect the mental well-being of our community,\u201d it said in a statement.\nOfficials encourage the public to reach out for help; services include mental health counseling, trauma processing, psychiatric services and resource guidance. Clinic hours will be 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Sunday, an expansion to help accommodate immediate needs.\nOfficials are still trying to get a handle on the fires\u2019 progress but know they\u2019re not fully contained, Hawaii Emergency Management spokesman Adam Weintraub in Honolulu said.\n\u201cWe are still in life preservation mode. Search-and-rescue is still a primary concern,\u201d he said. \u201cOur search-and-rescue teams from Maui and supporting agencies are not able to do their job until the fire lines are secure and they\u2019re sure that they\u2019re going to be able to get to those areas safely.\u201d\nHe asked for patience as officials try to get control of the crisis.\n\u201cI think that there is a great temptation to shift immediately to what went wrong, who\u2019s to blame. What we have here is a natural disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may have been questions that need to be examined about whether it was handled in the right way. But we still got people in danger. We still have people who don\u2019t have homes. We still have people who can\u2019t find their loved ones.\u201d\nThe state capitol in Honolulu will fly the Hawaii and U.S. flags at half-staff until further notice by order of Gov. Josh Green.\nGreen issued the order to represent the state's mourning of the dozens of people killed in the fires raging on the island chain.\nAs first responders continue their search-and-rescue operations, it's possible the death toll will climb.\nThere are six active fires on Maui and the Big Island, where roughly 2,000 acres have already burned, Hawaii Emergency Management said.\nThe acreage lost is likely to climb, officials say, as aerial damage assessment continues.\nOfficials are urging the public to beware of scams but encourage sending monetary donations as many families have lost everything to the wildfires.\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the \u201cdevastating wildfires\u201d in Hawaii at the top of his remarks today on the first anniversary of the PACT Act.\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s lost a loved one, whose home has been damaged or destroyed, is going to get help immediately,\u201d Biden said at the George E. Wahlen Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Salt Lake City.\nBiden commended the \u201cbrave\u201d firefighters, first responders and emergency personnel who have been \u201cworking around the clock\u201d and are \u201crisking their lives\u201d responding to the wildfires that have led to at least 36 deaths. He noted that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is coordinating disaster assistance and said he has directed all available federal assets to assist local emergency response crews to work \u201cas quickly as possible to fight these fires and evacuate residents and tourists.\u201d\n\u201cIn the meantime, our prayers are with the people of Hawaii \u2014 but not just our prayers,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery asset we have will be available in them. And we\u2019ve seen their homes, their businesses, destroyed, and some have lost loved ones. And it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\nA mass evacuation effort resumed Thursday for visitors and residents stranded just north of a historic town in Maui that was destroyed by a wildfire this week, officials said.\nBuses will pick up people in Kaanapali, north of Lahaina, taking visitors directly to the Kahului Airport and residents to a shelter in central Maui, the county of Maui announced on Facebook.\nThe wildfires, driven by strong winds from a hurricane passing far to the south of the island chain, raced through Lahaina and other parts of Maui on Tuesday night. At least 36 people died and dozens more were injured, officials said, and more than 271 structures were damaged or destroyed. The fire is the deadliest since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 people and virtually razed the town of Paradise.\nThe main road that runs along the western coastline of Maui \u2014 also the only road in and out of Lahaina \u2014 was closed to most traffic while firefighting and emergency rescue efforts continued.\nMore than 100 National Guardsmen have been sent to Hawaii to assist with the wildfire response, according to Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col. Devin Robinson.\nThe Army National Guard has activated 99 of its members and the Air National Guard will provide another 35 members to assist. The support will include assistance to Hawaii Emergency Management and local law enforcement.\nPresident Joe Biden approved Hawaii's disaster declaration, opening federal funding to Maui County, and to state and local recovery efforts.\nThe funds can include temporary housing grants and loans to cover uninsured property losses, according to a press release. He also said that funds are available for debris removal and \"emergency protective measures.\"\n\"Damage assessments are continuing, and additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments are fully completed,\" Biden said.\nVice President Kamala Harris offered her support and prayers to Maui wildfire victims Thursday.\n\u201cDoug and I are thinking about the families and communities devastated by the wildfires in Lahaina and across Maui,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWe pray for the heroic first responders who are fighting to protect the island and save lives.\u201d\n\u201cOur Administration has ordered federal support for response and rescue efforts in Hawaii, and we urge all residents to follow local alerts and instructions during this difficult time,\u201d she added.\nHawaiian Airlines announced in a tweet Wednesday that it will continue to operate flights for urgent travel between Maui and Honolulu for $19.\nThe airline said it is also \"coordinating with the state, county and non-profits to transport first responders, equipment and supplies to Maui.\"\nSouthwest Airlines is also providing $19 flights under its base fare \"Wanna Get Away\" option. A search for flights on Southwest's website shows the cheap one-way tickets from Maui are available to other areas in the island chain, including Honolulu and Kona.\nThe town of Lahaina, which has been largely reduced to ashes as wildfires continue to devastate the area, was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\nIt was recognized as the kingdom's political center in 1802, after King Kamehameha conquered several islands on the archipelago. Throughout the 1800s, the whaling and fishing industries in the area took off, making Lahaina a global trade hub.\nIt remained a political center of Hawaii until the capital was moved to Honolulu in 1845 and the U.S. began its efforts to colonize the kingdom, eventually usurping its government in 1887 and overthrowing the queen in a coup years later.\n\u201cOur home is on fire right now. There needs to be more action and more investment,\u201d said Kaniela Ing, who\u2019s seventh-generation K\u0101naka Maoli, or Indigenous Hawaiian, and grew up in the area. \u201cPeople hit first and worse by the climate crisis tend to be Black, indigenous and low income. Yet we\u2019re the keepers of the knowledge of how to build a society that wouldn\u2019t cause ecological collapse and societal doom.\u201d\nAbout 16% of Maui County\u2019s population was under \u201csevere drought\u201d conditions Tuesday, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor released Thursday.\nDrought levels across Hawaii also increased, with statewide moderate drought levels rising from 6% to 14% in the last week, according to agency data.\nThe increased drought severity may have contributed to the dry vegetation, which, coupled with Dora's winds and low humidity, caught fire.\nAs of 4 a.m. local time (10 a.m. ET) Thursday, over 10,900 customers are without power in Maui, according to PowerOutage.us.\nThat\u2019s a decrease from the 12,400 customers who were offline in West Maui on Wednesday afternoon.\nThere are no other major outages across the Hawaiian islands.\nHawaiian Electric asked for \"patience\" in Maui on Wednesday, saying it would \"move our restoration efforts to other areas if and as they become safe and accessible.\u201d\nLahaina's access to the internet has been almost entirely severed due to the recent fires.\nNetBlocks, a digital watchdog that tracks internet access, said Thursday that the community \"remains largely disconnected from the internet\" and that the outages are likely to hinder rescue efforts.\nAll mandatory evacuations were lifted as of 8 p.m. local time Wednesday (2 a.m. ET Thursday) in Big Island. The worst of the wildfires are blazing in the island of Maui.\nIn Big Island, all roads were opened to traffic and emergency evacuation shelters were closed.\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed was in Maui for a personal trip when the wildfires exploded, her office said Thursday.\nThe mayor left the island and is now in Oahu, following the Hawaii governor\u2019s order encouraging visitors to depart the island due to the blazes.\n\u201cThe Mayor was never in danger. This wildfire is devastating to witness and our thoughts are with the people of Maui,\u201d press secretary Parisa Safarzadeh said in a statement.\nOfficials in Hawaii warned Thursday that the death toll \u2014 already at 36 \u2014 could rise, with the fires still burning and teams spreading out to search charred areas.\nSearch and rescue teams are fanning out in the devastated areas in the hopes of finding survivors, Adam Weintraub, communications director for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, said Thursday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\nAddressing the fear that there could be additional deaths, he acknowledged that \u201cthese were large and fast-moving fires, and it\u2019s only recently that we\u2019ve started to get our arms around them and contain them. So, we\u2019re hoping for the best, but we\u2019re prepared for the worst.\u201d\nThirty-six people have died in the Maui County wildfires, officials said Thursday, as blazes continue to rage in the Hawaiian island.\nIn comparison to California's history of destructive and deadly fires, it ranks second on the list of the top 20 deadliest.\nThe 2018 Camp Fire killed 85, the 1993 Griffith Park blaze killed 29, and the Tunnel Fire of 1991 left 25 dead, according to Cal Fire records.\nThe fires in Maui also outpace the death toll of recent wildfires including the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Northern California that killed 22, the 2020 North Complex Fire that killed 16 and the LNU Complex Fire, also in 2020, that left six dead.\nUnited Airlines and American Airlines said Thursday they are sending planes to Maui to evacuate passengers whose travel plans were upended by wildfires blazing in the island.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve canceled today\u2019s inbound flights to Kahului Airport so our planes can fly empty to Maui and be used as passenger flights back to the mainland,\u201d United said in a statement.\nThe airline said it\u2019s monitoring the situation \u201cclosely\u201d and \u201cemphasizing safety as always and checking on the welfare of our employees on Maui.\u201d\nAmerican Airlines said it expects to operate all of Thursday's scheduled flights to and from Kahului Airport.\nThe airline said it \u201cadded an additional flight and upgraded an aircraft today to ensure customers evacuating are able to do so.\u201d\nAmerican Airlines customers whose travel plans were affected by the wildfires are able to rebook without fees, cancel or receive a refund.\nWarnings of high winds and the potential for extreme fire behavior were issued Tuesday, but where the fires would spark was impossible to predict, Adam Weintraub, Emergency Management Agency Communication director, said Thursday.\n\"You can\u2019t tell exactly where a tree is going to go down. You can\u2019t tell when a roof is going to come off and land on a power line. You can\u2019t tell when somebody\u2019s going to hit a rock with a lawn mower and spark a blaze,\" he said on NBC's \"TODAY\" show Thursday.\n\"We were seeing gusty winds that were up to 80 mph and when you get a flame in dry vegetation, in low humidity, in that kind of a wind environment, the flames can go anywhere,\" he said.\nEfforts to quell the flames and get people to safety continue.\n\"We are hoping for the best but we\u2019re not sure what the outcome will be,\" he said.\nThree fires remain active in Maui in Lahaina, Pulehu and Upcountry, the County of Maui said in a 10:30 p.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET) update.\nThe Maui Fire Department reported \u201cno significant changes\u201d on the three fires, and there are no new evacuations. No containment estimates were available.\nThe fire department will conduct an assessment at first light Thursday, officials said.\nThe county said firefighters have been facing \u201cmultiple flare-ups\u201d and additional firefighters were requested from Honolulu. Overnight, 30 U.S. Army service members arrived on the island and will conduct search and recovery efforts Thursday morning.\nMaui resident Dustin Kaleiopu said he and his family had just \u201cminutes to escape\u201d their home before fire consumed it.\nAt first, Tuesday morning seemed normal; it was windy and the electricity went out, which isn't uncommon, Kaleiopu told NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d on Thursday.\n\u201cBy 3:30 p.m., the smoke had started to get thicker \u2026 and it started to make its way closer to our home. We could hear the explosions happening around the block from the gas station and from businesses. By 4:30 p.m., our neighbor\u2019s yard was on fire,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe had minutes to escape because an hour later, we would find out that our home had burned completely to the ground,\u201d he added.\nHis father, who had no way of communicating with Kaleiopu, had returned to the home after work to search for his family, and found the house \u201ccompletely burned to the ground.\u201d\nKaleiopu's brother waited on the side of a highway on his father's route home and flagged him down and the family was ultimately reunited, he said.\nKaleiopu said that in a matter of just 36 hours, his town is gone and his world as he knew it altered.\n\u201cEvery single person that I work with, the people that I see at the bank, the grocery store, everyone I know is now homeless. In 36 hours, our town has been burnt to ash. There\u2019s nothing left,\u201d he said.\nPassengers try to sleep below a \u201cWelcome To Maui\u201d billboard while waiting for delayed and canceled flights at the Kahului Airport on Wednesday.\nSome 2,100 people are staying in shelters in Maui overnight following a mass evacuation of residents and tourists, Maui County has confirmed.\nTourists were evacuated from the Sheraton Maui Resort in Ka\u2019anapali on Wednesday, and evacuations would resume Thursday, according to the statement posted around 4:45 a.m. ET.\nService members from the U.S. Army arrived Wednesday night and were \u201cconducting search and recovery efforts\u201d early Wednesday, the statement said.\nSteff Baku-Kirkman covers her face after hearing reports her home and her pets were destroyed, in Lahaina on Wednesday.\nA warning of high winds across Hawaii was lifted early Thursday, as the effects of Dora begin to ease.\nA high pressure weather system will bring \"moderate to locally breezy trade winds across the region,\" but wind speeds will decrease to moderate throughout Thursday, the National Weather Service in Honolulu said in an update.\nWinds of up to 85 mph had stopped helicopters dropping water on the raging fires in Maui until Wednesday, when some 150,000 gallons were used to battel the flames.\nSmoke billows as wildfires driven by high winds destroy a large part of the historic town of Lahaina on Wednesday\nWhile the intense fires still rage in Maui, Hawaiian authorities are keen to tell the world that it is business as usual for the rest of the islands.\n\"What happened in western Maui is devastating. It\u2019s really, really sad and our prayers go out the families. But I also want people know who are traveling to Hawaii and who are already here, the rest of Hawaii is open,\" Jimmy Tokioka, director of the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, told a news conference Thursday.\nMore than 11,000 people have been evacuated from Maui so far and at least 36 people have been confirmed dead.\nThe fight to suppress the wildfires blazing in Maui has used more than 150,000 gallons of water so far, Maj.

        "title": "Emergency sirens weren't activated ahead of deadly Maui blaze: Recap",
        "text": "Coverage on this live blog has ended. Please follow our updates here.\nThe death toll in the Maui wildfires rose Friday to 67, as some residents were allowed to return to West Maui after the disaster.\nBut a fire Friday in West Maui prompted the evacuation of residents of Kaanapali, which has a population of around 1,100, Maui County police said Friday evening.\nThree wildfires have been burning on Maui. Containment of the Lahaina fire, which swept into the town of the same name and caused widespread damage, increased slightly to 85%, the County of Maui said.\nContainment of the Pulehu/Kihei fire was 80%, and the Upcountry Maui fire is 50 percent contained.\nMaui\u2019s warning sirens were not activated as deadly wildfires approached the town of Lahaina, emergency officials said. Three other alert systems were implemented, according to Hawaii Emergency Services Administration.\nSome survivors believe they were not sufficiently warned through emergency alerts as the crisis deepened, adding to the confusion in what has become one of Hawaii\u2019s deadliest natural disasters.\nSome residents were able to survey the damage, and what little has been left of their homes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a war zone,\u201d said Kimo Kirkman, who went back to get the remains of their two dogs and cat.\nOthers are still in the dark about whether their relatives and loved ones are alive or dead. There is no official number of missing known, and the death toll could go up as more remains are found in the wreckage of the town.\nGov. Josh Green and other officials on Saturday are expected to provide another update into the crisis, which he has said will most likely be the largest natural disaster in Hawaii\u2019s state history (it became a state in 1959).\nAs Hawaii continues its effort to contain wildfires across the Big Island and Maui, and a climbing death toll leaves residents shell-shocked, scientists across the United States have begun to take stock of the plants and animals that have been lost to the flames.\nThough Hawaii makes up less than 1% of U.S. land, it contains 44% of the country\u2019s endangered and threatened plant life. While some native plants can gradually recover from wildfires of this scale, others will likely be scorched beyond regrowth, experts said. No clear data is available yet on exactly what has been lost, but scientists fear the toll is significant.\nEvacuations were ordered in the western Maui community of  Kaanapali today after a fire, Maui County Police said.\nKaanapali is north of Lahaina, the town devastated by a wildfire this week, and according to U.S. census data it has a population of around  1,100.\nMaui County police said there are no restrictions for people to leave the west side of Maui. Earlier police had restricted traffic after people went around barricades, the department said.\nFirefighters on Maui have been fighting three wildfires, in addition to flare up fires, officials said.\n\"As of this posting, there is a fire in West Maui, residents in the Kaanapali are currently being evacuated,\" police said.\n\"At this time, there are no restrictions to exit the west side. Our priority is to ensure the safety of the community and first responders. We will allow entrance once it is safe to do so.\"\nThe devastation seen from the air above the Maui town of Lahaina is striking, with blocks of burned down buildings \u2014 a heartbreak even as help arrived in the form of aid arrived.\nEven at 400 feet up above the town that once housed more than 12,000 people in West Maui, there was a smell of smoke.\nNBC News correspondent Tom Llamas flew over Lahaina on Friday, three days after the fire, which was whipped by winds with gusts of 60 mph or more, swept into the community.\nThe road into Lahaina, the West Maui town devastated by a wildfire, was closed in both directions this afternoon, Maui County police announced.\nSome residents into the town with limited access had been allowed back earlier in the day.\nMaui County police in a social media post did not say why the road was closed. The County of Maui has said that burning areas are toxic, and barricades remained up around Lahaina.\nNBC affiliate KHNL of Honolulu reported, citing county officials,  that people being allowed back had not been following rules put in place by authorities, and going into places in Lahaina where they were not allowed.\nThe deadly Maui wildfire is already projected to be the second-costliest disaster in Hawaii history, behind only Hurricane Iniki in 1992, according to calculations by Karen Clark & Company, a prominent disaster and risk modeling company.\nThe deadly Lahaina fire that swept into the West Maui town of the same name, causing widespread damage, is 85 percent contained, Maui County said today.\nThere are two other wildfires on the island. The Pulehu/Kihei fire is 80 percent contained, the county said in an update, and the Upcountry Maui fire is 50 percent contained.\n\u201cFirefighters continue battling flare-ups in all three fires,\u201d the county said in a 3 p.m. (local time) update.\nKULA, Maui \u2014 Postal carrier Marra Gomes can point out the wreckage of one large home where multiple members of a family lived, or another house where the family of a relative\u2019s boyfriend once lived.\nThose homes, burned along with many others in Maui's wildfires, are ruins.\n\u201cThe toughest part is seeing all the families not here that I used to wave at. Or the two little kids up the street ... run to me and grab their mail,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes.\nGomes is delivering mail to those who remain. For many, they are holding mail at the post office.\nPeople who remain ask Gomes if she\u2019s OK, she said.\n\u201cWe just got to keep going. Just trying to make everybody feel like, life can still go on,\u201d Gomes said.\nThe wildfire that tore through the West Maui town of Lahaina and the surrounding area, killing at least 67 people, is one of the deadliest wildfires in modern American history.\nOnly the Camp Fire, which killed 85 people when it erupted and destroyed the California mountain community of Paradise in 2018, appears to have killed more.\nThe Camp Fire is considered by state officials to be the deadliest wildfire in California history and has been called in state hazard preparedness materials the deadliest wildfire in the United States in 100 years.\nIn 1871, the Peshtigo Fire in Wisconsin killed an estimated 1,200 to 2,400 people and is considered the deadliest wildfire in American history, according to a history by a National Weather Service science officer in Wisconsin.\nThe American Red Cross said Friday it has been at work 24 hours a day, providing 2,100 overnight shelter stays to those displaced by flames and evacuations in Hawaii.\nThe relief org said that an army of volunteers, including some of the 1,300  residents who recently began training for Red Cross duty, was expected to supplement its efforts in the coming days.\nThe nonprofit's main mission in the fire-ravaged areas of Maui and the Big Island has been to provide emergency shelter, but it's also providing food and emotional support, and it plans to help with damage estimates and distribution of relief supplies, according to a Red Cross statement.\nThe World Central Kitchen, the food-relief nonprofit founded by celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, is feeding first responders and victims. Some of its team members arrived in Maui earlier this week, the organization said on its social media channels.\n\"WCK\u2019s Relief Team reached Maui with hundreds of sandwiches that were quickly delivered to emergency workers fighting the blaze near Lahaina,\" it said in a statement. \"We are now visiting shelters and rural communities on Maui and the Big Island and will continue to identify and fill meal needs.\"\nThe U.S. Coast Guard crews that rescued 17 people fleeing a deadly fire were faced with rough seas, heavy smoke and fears that as many as 100 people needed saving, an official said today.\nSmoke prevented a helicopter crew from seeing the victims Tuesday, Coast Guard Capt. Aja L. Kirksey, commander of Coast Guard Sector Honolulu, said today.\nBoats faced rough seas from the extreme winds that helped fuel the wildfire in Lahaina, Kirksey said.\n\u201cThere was smoke and fire near the water, but they were fortunate to have been there during the rescues at a time when the smoke lifted, for them to be able to see the people who needed to be rescued,\u201d she said.\nThe reports of up to 100 people who had fled into the water was an estimate, she said. She described it as a \"really hectic scene.\"\nThe Coast Guard rescued 17 from Tuesday evening into early Wednesday, but some people may have been able to get out of the water themselves, she said.  Eight good Samaritan vessels also responded to an emergency broadcast for aid, she said.\nThe Coast Guard has not found anyone else in the water to rescue. One person was spotted by air in the water since then and recovered, and was described as unresponsive.\nThe number of confirmed deaths from a wildfire that struck the Lahaina area of Maui is now 67, Maui County said.\nThe previous confirmed deaths had been 55. Hawaii's governor has said he expected the numbers to rise.\nThe 12 additional fatalities were discovered as firefighters battled the Lahaina fire, which is still active, the county said.\nKAHULUI, Maui \u2014 Already having lost his home and his father\u2019s ashes, Kimo Kirkman returned to his ruined house in Lahaina for one reason: his dogs and cat.\n\u201cWe knew nothing was there, but me and my wife, there was no way we were going to leave our animals\u2019 bodies to just be thrown into the rubble,\u201d he said today. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t even a thought.\u201d\nThe devastation in Lahaina was like nothing Kirkman had ever seen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a war zone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just pure \u2014 I don\u2019t even have the words for it. I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\nKirkman knew his animals were likely dead because a tracking collar stopped tracking Tuesday afternoon, when the wind-whipped fire was hitting Lahaina.\nWhen he and his wife, Steffani, got to the home they talked to the dogs, hoping they would present themselves.\n\u201cAnd we went right to the bedroom to where we knew the dogs were, and both dogs were on the bed, and they were cuddling, they were next to each other. And our cat was in the shower about three feet away,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what they did. They were buddies, they were best friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just sad to know that they were alone.\u201d\nA trio of top federal officials was traveling to Hawaii to meet with state and local leaders in a show of unity and commitment to aid.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said its own leader, administrator Deanne Criswell, would headline the federal entourage. On Thursday, FEMA announced it would make money and loans available to qualified victims of wildfires in Maui County.\nLimited assistance would also be made available to victims in Hawaii County, FEMA said.\nGrants could be used for temporary housing and home repairs; low-interest loans can cover uninsured property losses, and programs targeting business owners are intended to help them rebuild and reopen, the administration said.\nOn Thursday, President Joe Biden declared a major disaster for the state.\nAlso on the trip will be the top leaders of the Small Business Administration and U.S. Fire Administration, Isabella Casillas Guzman and Lori Moore-Merrell, respectively, FEMA said.\nThe administration announced the travel plans Friday but did not say, when, exactly, meetings would take place.\nWarning sirens were not activated during Maui's deadly wildfires, the Hawaii Emergency Services Administration said today.\n\u201cNeither Maui nor HI-EMA activated warning sirens on Maui during the wildfire incident,\" the agency said, but three other alert systems were implemented.\nAlerts were sent by mobile devices, radio and television, and the county's opt-in resident alert system, the agency said.\n\"The sirens are used to alert the public to seek additional information; they do not necessarily indicate an evacuation,\" emergency officials said.\nResidents and tourists are being allowed to return to some areas of West Maui,  but a curfew will be enforced and some parts of Lahaina will remain off-limits, Maui County officials said.\nOfficials have implemented a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew for Lahaina and other hard-hit areas.\nWest Maui continued to be without water and power Friday. \u201cThe curfew is intended to protect residences and property,\u201d Maui County government said.\nA restricted zone in historic Lahaina town as well as other parts of West Maui devastated by the blaze will remain closed to the public as crews search for fire victims, the county said.\nResidents will need identification with a local address; visitors will need to show hotel reservations, officials said.\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green said he couldn't say for certain if Maui\u2019s emergency siren system was activated properly ahead of the deadly wildfires.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early for me to tell. Much of the equipment was destroyed with fire and it\u2019s a very remote place,\" Green told NBC News' Lester Holt on Friday. \"This was a western edge of the island of Maui. Of course, we would never diminish any kind of responsibility.\"\nWildfires, Green said, took residents by surprise because 80 mph-winds, the remnants of Hurricane Dora, knocked out telecommunications and essentially rendered the island dark. Fire personnel were also fighting three other fires, Green said.\n\u201cI\u2019m very reluctant to blame anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were fighting multiple fires that were being moved. Because of these winds, we\u2019re of course, like everyone else, dealing with the extreme changes, global warming, the drying of our land. And then when this storm passed to the south of Hawaii, that was the hurricane \u2014 it sent those winds.\u201d\nPope Francis is praying for those who were killed, injured or displaced by the Hawaii wildfires, as well as first responders and emergency personnel, according to the Vatican.\nFrancis invoked \u201cGod\u2019s blessings of strength and peace\u201d for all the people of Maui.\nNo cruise ships will be docking into the Kahului Harbor in Maui, according to the Hawaii Transportation Department.\nThe state\u2019s DOT made the announcement Friday and said cruise ship operations are halted because of the governor's executive proclamation signed Thursday that lasts through Aug. 31.\nThe public will be informed about future changes, according to the DOT.\nGreen said residents will be able to return to the wildfire-decimated Lahaina later Friday.\n\u201cFamilies will be able to get back into Lahaina today,\"  the governor told NBC affiliate KHNL of Honolulu. \"The mayor will be announcing the ability for people to go back in, to go to their homes, to go check on whatever was lost, and people will be able to get out too to get more water and services.\u201d\n\u201cThis will bring Hawaii together, but prepare yourself for the emotional turmoil because if I feel it \u2014 and I have the experience as an emergency guy who saw tragedy in the course of 25 years in the hospital \u2014 it will be shocking to a lot of other people,\u201d he said.\nHe said he expects the death toll to rise \u201csignificantly\u201d as search and rescue teams enter burned houses and structures.\nTop wind gust speeds above 80 mph were clocked across Hawaii this week, according to data from the National Weather Service.\nIn Hawaii County, a gust of 82 mph was recorded 4 miles north of Kawaihae at 4:35 p.m. local time Tuesday. Another 82 mph wind gust was reported in Oahu Forest in Honolulu County around the same time.\nIn Maui County, a 67 mph wind gust was reported in Na Kula at 7:35 a.m. Wednesday. Since Monday, the islands have been battered with wind gusts most frequently in the range of 45-65 mph.\nOprah Winfrey, a part-time Maui resident, handed out supplies at a local shelter for wildfire victims Thursday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little overwhelming, you know. But I\u2019m really so pleased to have so many people you know supporting and people just bringing what they can,\u201d she said to the BBC.\n\u201cI came earlier just to see what people needed, then went shopping because often, you know, you make donations of clothes or whatever it is, it\u2019s not really what people need. I actually went to Walmart and Costco, and got pillows, shampoo, diapers, sheets, pillowcases,\u201d Winfrey added.\nPosts on social media showed the media mogul walking around the shelter and handing out pillows to people sleeping on cots.\nA spokesperson for Oprah told NBC News: \u201cShe will do more, as it becomes clear which funds can be the most helpful for the short-term and long-term rebuilding.\u201d\nLauren S\u00e1nchez, the fianc\u00e9e of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos who has property on Maui, shared on Threads on Thursday that the couple will be also donating to help recovery efforts.\n\"The tragedy unfolding in Maui is beyond heartbreaking. Jeff and I have been on the phone with local residents and officials, and will be making donations to help,\u201d she wrote.\nA large banyan tree in the heart of Old Lahaina that was badly scorched by the fires that ransacked Maui appears to have emerged from the flames still standing.\nIn the aftermath of the devastating fires, residents are looking to the tree as a symbol of hope.\nThe banyan tree was just an 8-foot sapling when it was planted in 1873 as a gift shipped from India, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the first Protestant mission in Lahaina, which at the time was Hawaii\u2019s capital.\nIts sprawling branches \u2014 some stretching more than 60 feet \u2014 provided shade to many generations there.\nJohn-Mario Sevilla, 60, grew up in Maui and would often visit Lahaina with his family. He previously told NBC News he remembers sitting in church as the ocean breeze blew in through the open windows, and watching the traditional dancing under the banyan tree.\nNew photos show Hawaiian officials walking through the scorched remains of Lahaina on Thursday, where buildings were reduced to piles of rubble and mangled metal.\nMaui County shared the photos showing Bissen and Green walking along the once-bustling Front Street, the historical Sugar Cane Train and Banyan Court, all eerily quiet and covered in soot.\nOne photo shows the historic Lahaina banyan tree, which was planted in April 1873. The massive exotic Indian banyan stands over 60 feet high and has 46 major trunks according to the Lahaina Restoration Foundation. It appeared to be standing strong, with smoke damage visible by some bases.\nHawaiian Airlines CEO and President Peter Ingram said the airline is taking the evacuation process \u201cday by day\u201d and it\u2019s unclear how many people still need to be evacuated from the tropical tourist hot spot.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really been treating it as how much capacity can we put in the air. We\u2019ve added extra flights yesterday, we\u2019ve got extra flights ready to go today, we\u2019re going to operate that schedule and we\u2019re prepared to have extra flights through the weekend,\u201d he said on MSNBC on Friday.\nWeary travelers arriving at the airport and boarding flights to Honolulu have been \u201cgrateful,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think many of the guests who have arrived at the airport, particularly the people who arrived on buses from those affected areas, they\u2019re just so relieved to get somewhere where\u2019s there\u2019s power, there\u2019s running water, where they can get a bite to eat,\u201d Ingram said.\nIngram said in a statement Thursday that almost 500 employees call Maui home.\n\u201cI know our teammates are very worried about their community. Many of them have family members who have lost properties, close friends that they haven\u2019t been able to get in touch with yet, but they\u2019re really just trying to extend our Hawaiian hospitality to the guests that we know need to get on their way and get off of Maui and people are just really focused on taking care of that mission,\u201d Ingram said.\nVice President Kamala Harris told reporters Friday the White House is monitoring the catastrophe in Hawaii \u201cclosely.\u201d\n\u201cWe are coordinating federal resources to swiftly get there to support the work that has to be done both in terms of recovery, but to just support the folks on the ground,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is tragic what has happened there. I have full faith and confidence in the leadership in Hawaii to stay on top of this, but they will have our full support,\u201d Harris said. \u201cOur prayers are with the families and with the leaders.\u201d\nShe said she\u2019d like to go to Hawaii to tour the damage, but doesn't want to distract from the needs of the victims and first responders.\n\"We want to, obviously, as with most of these situations, do whatever is in the best interest of the folks on the ground,\" Harris said.\nLahaina resident May Wedelin Lee said she\u2019s \u201clucky to be alive\u201d after she frantically evacuated her historic town, much of it now reduced to smoldering rubble.\n\u201cI\u2019m just lucky to get out of there when I did. It\u2019s just the worst scenario possible times ten,\u201d she said on NBC News Now. \u201cIt\u2019s seeing everything you love, seeing your whole life just go up in flames, literally go up in flames, in front of you.\u201d\nShe said she and her neighbors, who live in the heart of Lahaina, were watching the smoke for a couple of hours. It wasn\u2019t until she saw a palm tree about 50 yards away catch fire that she realized she needed to escape.\n\u201cIt was minutes, it happened so fast. The smoke jumped, the fire jumped, explosions were happening,\u201d she recalled.\nThankfully, she was able to account for most people in her inner circle. Now, the survivors of Lahaina need supplies, food and, most importantly, a roof over their heads, she said.\n\u201cLahaina is a very special community. We\u2019ve been through a lot in these last few years and we\u2019re close and I just pray that we can rebuild and that the focus can be us and not tourism, that it can be us,\" Lee said.\nDr. Reza Danesh, an emergency room doctor who responded to Lahaina this week, recalled the horrific stories survivors shared with him of swimming out to sea to escape flames engulfing Maui.\nThe fire spread in a matter of 30 seconds from block to block in the historic seaside town that was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, he said.\n\u201cThat whole front street and that whole area just burned down and people ran into the water, they were jumping into the ocean, they were paddling out to sea,\" Danesh said on NBC's \"TODAY\" show Friday.\n\"This one girl said she held on to like some metal rod or something in the middle, like 30 yards out, for like seven hours until she was able to come back in. Her friend was hanging on with her and her friend didn\u2019t survive. Kind of like a 'Titanic' story,\u201d he said.\nThe Coast Guard said 14 people, including two children, who went into the ocean to escape the blazes and smoke Tuesday evening, were rescued.\nDr. Reza Danesh, who runs an urgent care center and mobile clinic, Modo Mobile, described the horror of seeing Lahaina after wildfires raged through, describing it as a \u201cwar zone.\u201d\n\u201cI started getting text messages from some of the EMS people, paramedics and firefighters, that there\u2019s bodies on the ground, like lots. And that was kind of disturbing. It was just kind of surreal,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show Friday.\nHe said that when he first arrived with his mobile unit, parts of Lahaina were still on fire.\n\u201cI could see trees burning, I could feel the smoke, I could feel the heat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was basically like another pandemic, to explain it. It was a ghost town, very apocalyptic.\u201d\nHe said he found survivors, some in need of medical care, and others needing food and water.\nDanesh said he was mentally ready for battle, armed with items for wound and burn care, but found that survivors needed much more.\n\"It was the people with chronic diseases that were going to become acute medical issues. People with seizure meds, diabetics, hypertension, people just didn\u2019t have their medication,\u201d he said.\nAdding to the medical crisis, a pharmacy had burned down, there was no electricity, and no cellphone signal, he said.\nFirefighters continue to work to contain fires in Lahaina, Pulehu/Kihei and Upcountry Maui and extinguish flare-ups, the county said in an update Friday at 2:45 a.m. local time (8:45 a.m. ET).\nThe efforts to tame the blazes were bolstered by 21 firefighters from the Honolulu Fire Department, seven supervisory personnel and four vehicles. A Federal Emergency Management Agency search and rescue team with the Nevada Task Force arrived Thursday night with two K-9 cadaver dogs, the update said.\nPower was stored to Upcountry water pumping stations early Friday, and \u201cwater will be restored after lines are flushed,\u201d the county said. Meanwhile, officials said \u201csome cellphone service was available in West Maui today.\u201d\nAround 10,900 people remain without power in Maui, according to PowerOutage.us as of 3:30 a.m. local time (9:30 a.m. ET).\nFood, water, supplies and clothing, as well as a limited supply of baby products, will be distributed to residents from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time Friday at the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua.\nOn Thursday, 14,900 visitors left Maui on flights, the county said in an update early Friday.\nAmerican Airlines and United Airlines had flown empty planes to the island Thursday to aid in evacuating travelers whose plans were upended by the wildfires.\nEarlier Thursday, tourism officials reported that more than 11,000 people had been evacuated.\nMike Cicchino and his wife, Andreza, dove into the ocean to escape getting burned when flames engulfed their neighborhood this week.\n\u201cThe current was pulling us out. You can\u2019t see anything. At one point, we have fire on us and we don\u2019t know where land is,\u201d he said in an interview that aired Friday on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show.\nWhen they made it back to shore and looked for their dogs, they were met by the desperate cries of their neighbors.\n\u201cIt was like every 10 feet was \u2018Help! Help!\u2019 And I helped as many people as I possibly could but I couldn\u2019t go any further, because there was just too much heat,\u201d Cicchino said.\nAnother couple, Sam and Josie Younger, said they escaped their beachfront home with seconds to spare when a blaze broke out.\n\u201cIt was unspeakable, unthinkable really, just seeing what was going on, all the destruction, all the people,\u201d Younger told NBC News\u2019 Dana Griffin, who is on the ground in Hawaii.\nDespite the devastation on the island, Younger said, he's remains hopeful Maui will bounce back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna take a lot of work and a lot of years and a lot of manpower but I have no doubt that it will bounce back.\u201d\nQuestions have swirled on whether the siren system in Maui failed to properly warn residents to evacuate as wildfires rapidly spread in the island's west side.\nBissen said on NBC's \"TODAY\" show Friday: \u201cI think this was an impossible situation.\u201d\n\"The winds that hit us in on that side of the island \u2026 in some areas, gusts were up to 80 mph, some sustained between 45 and 60-65 mph. So, everything happened so quickly,\" he explained. \"I can\u2019t comment on whether or not the sirens sounded or not, but I know the fires came up so quickly and they spread so fast. There were some initially, when there was a smaller fire, homes were evacuated.\"\nHe noted that \"many, many\" people evacuated from their homes as 2,100 people were in shelters Tuesday night, not including many visitors in Kaanapali who sheltered in place in their hotels.\n\"Again, there was no power, there was no water. So that\u2019s what we were dealing with,\" he added.\nHawaii Emergency Management records showed no indication that warning sirens were triggered before the fires erupted, officials said, and some Lahaina survivors said they didn\u2019t hear any sirens, but fled when they saw flames or heard explosions, The Associated Press reported.\nBissen said the focus in Maui is finding missing people and reuniting families as the death toll mounted to 55.\n\u201cI think that number could go up,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show Friday, noting so far the victims found were outside buildings.\n\u201cSo we have not yet searched in the interior of the buildings. We\u2019re waiting for FEMA to help with that search as they are equipped to handle the hazmat conditions of the building.\u201d\n\u201cRight now, our focus is on finding any missing persons, we want to reunite families, we want to give people information whether their family members at one of our shelters or whether they are among those who have perished, we need to get that information to our citizens,\" he said.\nThe west side of the island in Lahaina is still in crisis: no power, no water, no communication ability, no internet or phone service, the mayor said. Crews have been going to the impacted areas with supplies and water, he added.\nA man who stayed behind in the devastated town of Lahaina has described the horror of seeing bodies in the sea and in the streets.\nCommercial fisherman Bryan Sizemore, 48, said by phone early Thursday that he saw \u201cat least a dozen corpses\u201d when he went into the town Wednesday. He flagged police officers to the location of one body and later saw it being recovered from the street.\n\u201cThe town is completely gone,\u201d he said. \u201cPower lines are down. You\u2019ll see whole neighborhood burned out, but then there\u2019ll be one or two houses still standing, barely dirty,\u201d he said.\nSizemore has stayed in Lahaina to protect his store from looters, but there\u2019s no running water or electricity and food is scarce, he said. He\u2019s surviving on snack bars and a case of bottled water given by friends.\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see nothing like this. You know when you watch movies, it\u2019s a possibility, but not in real life,\" he said.\nSurvivors of the fires that have devastated Maui will be offered mental health services, including counseling, Green's office said late Thursday.\nThe Maui Community Mental Health Center will provide \"crisis mental health services and expanding hours to those experiencing emotional or psychological distress as a result of the Maui wildfires,\" the statement said.\nThe services include mental health counseling, trauma processing, psychiatric services and resource guidance.\nAnyone seeking these services should contact Maui CMHC at (808) 984-2150 or via email at mauiwellness@doh.hawaii.gov, or in person at 121 Mahalani Street in Wailuku.\nA restaurant on the Lahaina seafront belonging to Fleetwood Mac drummer and founding member Mick Fleetwood was completely destroyed by wildfire, he said Thursday.\n\"MAUI and The Lahaina community have been my home for several decades. This is a devastating moment for MAUl and many are suffering unimaginable loss,\" Fleetwood wrote on Instagram.\n\"On behalf of myself and my family I share my heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the people of MAUI. We are committed to supporting the community and those affected by this disaster in the days month and years to come.\"\n\u201cWhat we saw today was likely the largest natural disaster in Hawaii state history,\u201d Green said in a statement late Thursday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a great deal of time to recover from this, but we have the support from every level of government all the way up to the federal level, especially given President Biden\u2019s approval of my disaster declaration request today. It will be a tremendous effort, but we will come together as a community and begin working toward rebuilding from this tragedy.\u201d\nNearly 11,000 customers in the worst-affected western Maui remain without power, a live map of outages by electricity provider Hawaiian Electric shows.\nEarlier Thursday, the company said access continues to be limited to many impacted areas because of safety and emergency response concerns, and power restoration will be prioritized to areas that the crews can safely access.\nThe company also said that it's asking customers in the area to prepare for extended outages that could last several weeks.\nAerial images taken Thursday show destroyed homes and buildings burned to the ground in Lahaina along the Pacific Ocean in the aftermath of wildfires in western Maui.\nThe thousands of survivors displaced by the Maui wildfires need support and donations, Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke said late Thursday. She posted links to the local branch of the Red Cross, as well as other local charities and a food bank on X, the site formerly known as Twitter.\nMaui and Hawaii Island farmers who suffered damage in the wildfires this week will be able to use an emergency agricultural loan program announced by the state Agriculture Department on Thursday.\nThe farmers and ranchers are encouraged to apply now if they believe they will need financial assistance, the Hawaii Board of Agriculture said, as damage estimates may take some time to fully assess.\nTalk show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey visited wildfire evacuees in Maui on Thursday.

        "title": "Death toll rises to 89 in Hawaii, making it the deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history",
        "text": "Coverage on this live blog has ended. Please follow our updates here.\nThe death toll in the Maui wildfires rose to 89, officials said Saturday, with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green cautioning that it was likely to continue to grow.\nThe revised number of fatalities has put the fire, which devastated the town of Lahaina, as the deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history, surpassing the 2018 Camp Fire in California that killed 85.\nAs people wait and hope for news about their loved ones and homes, the community has stepped up efforts to distribute supplies to those who lost everything.\nIn Maui, dozens of volunteers gathered near Maalaea Harbor to collect water, gas and other supplies, some calling out a chant, rallying together those gathered to help, as they loaded vehicles.\n\u201cMaui has Maui right now, and now Oahu is here supporting Maui,\u201d community member Anthony Jensen told NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this as one big family, one big ohana, and that\u2019s our mission right now is just to support the people who really need it.\u201d\nThousands of gallons of water and ready-to-eat meals will be needed each day for displaced residents, in addition to shelter for 4,500 people, FEMA and the Pacific Disaster Center said.\nThe fire damaged or destroyed an estimated 2,207 structures in Lahaina, and the majority of buildings impacted were residential, according to damage assessments.\nThe devastation resulting from a complex of fires on Maui that started Tuesday represents the deadliest U.S. fire in recent years, U.S. Fire Administrator Lori Moore-Merrell said.\n\"This fire now has become the deadliest in the last 10 years,\" she announced at a Saturday news conference convened by Gov. Josh Green.\nThe Maui complex of fires also represent the deadliest U.S. fire in the last 100 years. California's Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 85, previously held that title.\nOfficials waned that the death troll would continue to climb as search and recovery teams planned to cover more ground in upcoming days.\nGov. Josh Green said Saturday that strong winds in Hawaii midweek may have made the fires on Maui unstoppable.\nAs questions grow regarding state and local officials' initial responses to the nascent blazes Tuesday, the governor pointed to a culprit hard to tame in any circumstance: Trade winds boosted by a high pressure system.\n\"The largest force in play that night were 80 mph winds,\" Green said during a news conference on the fires and their aftermath. \"Fortunately, now those winds have passed.\"\nThe National Weather Service published a summary of peak wind gusts in Hawaii for Monday through Wednesday. The strongest wind recorded in Maui during that span was a 67 mph gust on Wednesday. The most powerful wind on the Big Island was a gust of 82 mph recorded Tuesday.\nGreen suggested that the winds' sudden and insurmountable force would have whipped hungry flames through West Maui regardless of the human reaction.\n\"Having seen that storm,\" Green said, \"we have doubts that much could have been done with a fast-moving fire like that.\"\nChief John Pelletier of the Maui Police Department on Saturday braced the public for more devastation in West Maui because the search, recovery, and identification process remains in its earliest stage.\nHe said during Saturday's news conference no identities for the deceased have been completed in a process that can include rapid DNA testing, dental record comparisons, and informing family members.\n\"Every one of these 89 are John and Jane Does,\" the chief said.\nThe death toll will increase, Pelletier said, and it's unclear where it will end up.\n\"None of us really knows the size of it yet,\" Pelletier said. \"You want it fast, or you want it right? We\u2019re going to do it right.\"\nHe said only 3% of an area of Maui that is under search and recovery plans has been covered. \"We're going as fast as we can,\" Pelletier said.\nThe chief noted that the heat and humidity of Maui were most likely slowing down search and rescue dogs deployed for the mission. \"We can only go as fast as the animal can go,\" he said.\nPelletier cited island cultural principles and said search, recovery and identification would be done in the spirit of aloha and respect.\nWith 89 confirmed deaths in the Maui wildfires, which were swept by extreme winds into the town of Lahaina, the disaster officially becomes deadlier than California\u2019s Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 85.\nThat notorious California fire was also swept by high winds into the small mountain communities of Concow, Paradise and Magalia in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Paradise and Concow were almost destroyed.\nUntil Saturday the fire had been the deadliest in American history in the last 100 years, officials have said.\nThe Camp Fire ignited on Nov. 8, 2018, and had \u201cextreme rates of spread\u201d due to dry conditions and high winds, state fire investigators have said.\nIt began in Pulga, and a second point of ignition was vegetation that went into power lines, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in 2019. It was ignited by a fault electric transmission line and winds drove it into the communities, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has said. Pacific Gas & Electric later pleaded guilty to 84 manslaughter counts.\nIn announcing the death toll in Maui's devastating fires has risen from 80 to 89 in the span of a day, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said on Saturday that the number would continue to rise.\n\"There are 89 fatalities that have been measured,\" he said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s going to continue to rise. We want to brace people for that.\"\nSearch and recovery crews were continuing to comb through fire-scorched communities, including historic Lahaina town in West Maui, where the worst of the fires struck swiftly after the blazes began Tuesday.\nThe death toll in fires that have ravaged Maui since Tuesday increased to 89, Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii said Saturday.\nSpeaking at an evening news conference, Green said, \"It\u2019s going to continue to rise. We want to brace people for that.\"\nThe previous death toll of 80 confirmed deaths was announced early Saturday with the caveat that search and recovery operations were likely to turn up more remains in fire-scorched communities in West Maui.\nAs the death toll from the fires on Maui rises, it\u2019s unclear how morgues will be able to accommodate the number of victims considering there are just one hospital and three mortuaries. The number of deaths has risen to 80, according to a statement by Maui County on Friday. Beyond the confirmed deaths in Maui, hundreds of other people remain unaccounted for.\nIn response to the anticipated need for emergency housing due to the  wildfires Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi directed the Department of Planning and Permitting (DPP) to suspend the short-term vacation rental 30\u2013day minimum rental period requirement to increase the availability of temporary housing on O\u02bbahu.\n\u201cIn the spirit of wanting to do everything possible to help with this devastating and heartbreaking tragedy, we are suspending the 30-day requirement for short-term vacation rentals to help provide housing on O\u02bbahu for those most in need,\u201d said Blangiardi. \u201cWe hope that this will provide some relief for any of our displaced neighbors who are in need of a safe place to stay during these trying times.\u201d\nSome fear the number of people missing in the Maui fires could be as high as 1,000. One Maui resident hopes her grandmother has escaped as she struggles to reach her.\n\"We don\u2019t know where she is,\" the woman told NBC's \"Nightly News.\"\nWhen asked what she would want to say to her grandmother, the woman said: \"I would tell her \u2018we\u2019re looking for her. Grandma, we\u2019re looking for you. If you can reach a phone, call us, let us know where you're at.'\"\nSo many others are also desperate for contact with their missing loved ones.\n\"What goes through my mind is do I just go over there and find my dad because no one else is,\" another woman said, getting emotional. \"If he did get evacuated, where did he get evacuated to? There's no information regarding that.\"\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Pacific Disaster Center estimate that 51,700 square feet of shelter will be needed for 4,500 people as a result fires on Maui.\n3,560 gallons of clean water are also estimated to be required, as well as 9,000 ready to eat meals per day of displacement.\nNorwegian Cruise Line is donating $50,000 to help with the fires in Maui, the company said Saturday.\n\"We are deeply saddened to hear about the wildfires currently impacting the town of Lahaina in Maui. We have a very special relationship with the people and islands of Hawaii, as we sail to the beautiful state year-round,\" the cruise liner said. \"It is a magical destination and one that is highly sought out by our guests for its natural beauty, culture and unparalleled experiences.\"\nCruises with stops in Maui will be redirected to Hilo with an additional overnight stay in Nawiliwili, Kauai for itineraries beginning Aug. 12, 2023, through the end of the month.\nNorwegian has also dedicated a team aboard its ship Pride of America to begin collecting items including clothing, diapers and towels. The donations will be given to the Hawaii Community Foundation.\nOn Friday, Metallica's nonprofit All Within My Hands also donated $200,000 to the foundation.\n\"With strong ties to the Hawaiian Islands, the All Within My Hands board voted swiftly to approve a $200,000 grant for the Maui Strong Fund established through the Hawai\u2019i Community Foundation (HCF),\" a news release states.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Saturday it had deployed more than 150 personnel, including search and rescue teams, with more on the way. Today, Disaster Survivor Assistance teams are in Maui to help residents register for assistance and address any critical needs in the affected neighborhoods.\nThe organization said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was in Hawaii today with U.S. Fire Administrator Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell and Administrator Isabella Guzman of the U.S. Small Business Administration to meet with Gov. Josh Green and other officials to assess the damage.\nScattered showers and up to 39 mph winds are forecast this week in Lahaina, according to the National Weather Service field office in Honolulu.\nThis weekend, isolated showers are expected along with up to 21 mph winds. The rain will continue into next week along with temperatures ranging from 63 to 73 degrees.\nWind gusts will pick up gradually throughout the week and peak on Tuesday at 39 mph, the National Weather Service said.\nThousands of structures have been damaged or destroyed in the Lahaina fire burning in Maui County, officials said.\nDamage assessments show that as of Friday, 2,719 structures have been exposed with 86% classified as residential buildings, according to the Pacific Disaster Center. Just over 2,200 structures were either demolished or mangled.\nMore than 2,000 acres have burned in the fire, the agency said.\nKing Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, extended their condolences to the Lahaina fire victims in a message to President Joe Biden.\n\"We can only begin to imagine the scale of the devastation engulfing the island, and the heartrending anguish of those whose livelihoods have been so disastrously affected,\" he wrote.\n\"However inadequate it may be,\" he continued, \"we both wanted to send our deepest possible sympathy to the families of those who have so tragically lost their lives, and our prayers remain with all those whose loved ones are missing and whose homes have been destroyed.\"\nPolice have shut down access to Lahaina at the Maalaea checkpoint. The checkpoint was open for approximately 90 minutes before the closure as some drivers spent more than 15 hours in line waiting, since Friday, to get in to Lahaina today.\nPolice told NBC news there was now too much traffic backed up on the road and conditions were dangerous. Frustrated drivers said police were now directing them to travel to Lahaina via the \"back way,\" around the northern tip of the island. Drivers said the northern route narrows to just one lane in spots.\nThe aloha spirit has been a source of comfort for many locals, including Tiffany Winn, who lost her business in Lahaina.\n\"The nice thing about Lahaina, it's such a sense of family. Everybody watches out for each other,\" Winn told NBC's Dana Griffin. \"And when tragedies happen, everybody bans together.\"\nWinn lost her gift shop, one of the oldest on Front Street, in the fire. \"It\u2019s essentially gone now, just like all the other buildings around it,\" she said.\nWinn said she was on her way to the store but was having difficulty getting there because of road closures from brush fires. She said the wind was so strong that it was knocking shingles off the houses.\nAs a precaution, she called her employee and told her to close the shop.\n\"We\u2019re really fortunate in our timing to get out when we did,\" Winn said, noting that there wasn't a warning about the massive fire. \"There were warnings of brush fires but nothing that would have given anybody a clue that it would have been this significant.\"\n\"I just think it happened so fast, like a firestorm,\" she added.\nAlex Lee and his family were visiting Maui from North Carolina when they saw \"dark smoke\" and then a \"puff\" that got bigger and bigger, he told NBC's Tom Llamas.\nThey decided to evacuate as a precaution and camp out at the Maui airport until they could catch a flight home. \"It's been rough, a rough couple of days,\" Lee said, sitting next to a makeshift bed on the floor.\nOthers vacating in Hawaii have been forced to do the same. Two families who were vacationing together had been at the airport for more than 30 hours. \"It's very sad,\" one of the women said of the destruction the fire left behind.\nMaui County announced that because of the new fire at Pu\u2019ukoli\u2019i on the evening of Aug. 12, the county could not open a fuel distribution center at the Pu\u2019ukoli\u2019i site  Aug. 13.\nThe county purchased gasoline and diesel from Maui Oil and arranged distribution via tanker at Pu\u2019ukoli\u2019i on Thursday and Friday for those affected by the Lahaina fires.\nThe Pu\u2019ukoli\u2019i fire was contained Friday night, but the main Lahaina fire remains active.\nMaui Police shut down the main road into Lahaina just before 4 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET).\nThe Maui Police Department said the closure was \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d according to a Facebook post.\nLaw enforcement had begun to allow members of the public to bypass road blocks to check on property hours before this recent closure.\nFEMA said Saturday afternoon that  it was too early to estimate rebuilding costs in the wake of the Lahaina wildfires.\n\"FEMA has not estimated any costs, as they are still in the active response and recovery phases,\" an agency spokesperson told NBC News.\nEarlier in the day, Maui County had posted a graphic on Facebook citing the Pacific Disaster Center and Federal Emergency Management Agency and a figure of an estimated $5.52 billion.\nFEMA noted that that figure was listed as \u201ccapital exposed,\u201d  which, FEMA said,  is not a measure of rebuilding costs.\nA total of 4,522 utility customers still do not have power in Hawaii as of Saturday morning, according to Poweroutage.us.\nIt's not clear how many of these customers live in Lahaina.\nHawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez will conduct a \"comprehensive review of decision-making and standing policies\" leading up to, during and after the wildfires, she said in a statement Friday.\nLopez said her office \u201cshares the grief\u201d felt by all on Hawaii and her department was \u201ccommitted to understanding the decisions that were made before and during the wildfires and to sharing with the public the results of this review.\u201d\n\u201cAs we continue to support all aspects of the ongoing relief effort, now is the time to begin this process of understanding,\u201d she said.\nA fire that caused an evacuation in Kaanapali has been extinguished, Hawaii\u2019s Department of Transport said on Twitter.\nThe fire erupted in an area where a county fueling station was set up to distribute about 3,000 gallons of gasoline and 500 gallons of diesel fuel for about 400 waiting vehicles, the department said.\nIt added that fuel would not be distributed on Saturday.\nThe inhalation of dust and other airborne particles unleashed by the \"highly toxic\" burning areas could be a health hazard, Maui County officials warned.\nAs a result barricades remained in place around Lahaina town, Maui County officials said in a statement, adding that police officers had been marshaling people away from unsafe areas.\nSearch and rescue teams with expertise in finding human remains have been deployed to Hawaii from Arizona and Nevada, Maui County said in an update Friday.\nFive dogs have also been deployed to help, the update said.\nHarmful contaminants, including benzene and other volatile organic chemicals, may have entered the Lahaina water system, Maui County officials warned.\nAs a result, residents should not drink tap water or use it for cooking, even if it is boiled, the officials said in a statement adding that some water structures had been destroyed in the fire.\n\u201cBottled water should be used for all drinking (including baby formula and juice), brushing teeth, and making ice and food preparation until further notice,\u201d the statement said.\nThe number of fatalities has risen to 80, Maui County officials said in a statement late Friday, but Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen has warned that the number of dead will likely continue to rise.\nEvacuations were ordered in the western Maui community of Kaanapali today after a fire, Maui County Police said.\nKaanapali is north of Lahaina, the town devastated by a wildfire this week, and according to U.S. census data, it has a population of around 1,100.\nMaui County police said there were no restrictions for people leaving the west side of Maui. Earlier officers had restricted traffic after people went around barricades, the department said.\n\u201cOur priority is to ensure the safety of the community and first responders. We will allow entrance once it is safe to do so,\u201d said the department.\nAs Hawaii continues its effort to contain wildfires across the Big Island and Maui, and a climbing death toll leaves residents shell-shocked, scientists across the United States have begun to take stock of the plants and animals that have been lost to the flames.\nThough Hawaii makes up less than 1% of U.S. land, it contains 44% of the country\u2019s endangered and threatened plant life. While some native plants can gradually recover from wildfires of this scale, others will likely be scorched beyond regrowth, experts said. No clear data is available yet on exactly what has been lost, but scientists fear the toll is significant.\nThe deadly Maui wildfire is already projected to be the second-costliest disaster in Hawaii history, behind only Hurricane Iniki in 1992, according to calculations by Karen Clark & Company, a prominent disaster and risk modeling company.",

Two had been identified but their names were not released.\nThe county also reported that the 678-acre Upcountry/Kula Fire was 60% contained, the 2,170-acre Lahaina fire was at 85%; and the Pulehu/Kihei fire was fully contained.\nHawaiian Electric said power had been restored to 60% of customers who had been without since Tuesday, as crews continued working to get about 5,000 other customers back online.\nEssential service providers \u2014 a market and two gas stations \u2014 reopened in Lahaina, and free shuttles were being offered from shelters to stores in the area.\nGov. Josh Green said state officials were investigating whether anything more could have been done to activate sirens early enough to warn residents about wildfires.\nHe also noted that the fires were likely to be the largest natural disaster in Hawaii\u2019s history and that damages could be close to $6 billion.\nIn evening update after he returned to Honolulu, Green said emergency housing would include more than 500 hotels rooms for survivors, and still more rooms for first responders. Airbnbs will be used, and \u201cthere ultimately will be rent subsidies,\u201d he said.\nOprah Winfrey was allowed inside a shelter to comfort fire victims after she agreed to have her camera crew remain outside.\nThe famed banyan tree in the heart of Old Lahaina was still standing and county officials said it may survive.\nIn an update Sunday, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green emphasized the need for housing for survivors, evacuees, and first responders and other workers in Maui to search, recover, and rebuild.\nHis address came via a video recorded at his office desk following his return to Honolulu from Maui.\nGreen said the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have pledged to help clear and rebuild historic Lahaina and other fire-ravaged areas.\nEmergency housing will include more than 500 hotels rooms for survivors, and even more rooms for first responders, he said. The \"Airbnb-industry\" will provide short-term rentals for longer time frames for local workers, whose housing costs may be supplemented by the government, the governor said.\nEvacuees of Maui's historic fires are being offered free shuttles to stores in Central Maui under a service that launched Sunday, Maui County officials said.\nThe 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. shuttle takes those in Central Maui shelters to stores in the area, the county said in a statement.\nThe news came as county officials also noted Napili Market in Lahaina has reopened with 24-hour access for consumers.\nAlso, two Lahaina gas stations Minit Stop and Kahana Gateway Shell, have also reopened with the help of the restoration of electricity lines, the county said.\nThe county also reported that  the 678-acre Upcountry/Kula Fire was 60% contained on Sunday; the 2,170-acre Lahaina fire, initially said to be 100% contained on Aug. 8, was on Sunday 85% contained; and the Pulehu/Kihei fire, no acreage given, was fully contained.\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell briefed Biden tonight from Maui, according to the White House, which did not release details. He was also briefed this morning, the White House said.\nU.S. Fire Administrator Lori Moore-Merrell, also speaking in Maui, echoed Hawaii\u2019s governor in saying the fires, the deadliest in modern U.S. history, were all but unstoppable.\n\"This fire was very fast, moving in horizontal nature, low to the ground and outpaced anything the firefighters could have done in the early hours,\" she said. \"The heroic actions of the firefighters in response to this wildfire in Maui needs to be commended. FEMA is on the ground and will continue to support Hawaii throughout the response and recovery process, ensuring resilience is part of that plan.\u201d\nHawaiian Electric said today that it had restored power to 60% of customers who have been without since Tuesday.\nEfforts to get electricity back to 5,000 other customers in West Maui and Upcountry were continuing, the utility said.\nBecause of damage to the system at the distribution and substation levels, the company said, the system is still fragile, and intermittent outages may continue. All Maui customers were asked to limit nonessential uses.\nA Lahaina resident said cellphones are ringing in body bags as survivors desperately look for their missing family members.\nPointing to structures that belonged to his aunt and uncle, Charlie, 55, who has lived in Lahaina his whole life, said, \u201cSo, I know every family that lost their home.\u201d\nThe fire moved quickly though the area, leaving it looking \"like a war zone,\" Charlie said.\nOprah Winfrey was initially denied access to an emergency shelter in Maui today, but she did visit with fire victims after agreeing to  leave her camera crew outside, Maui County said today.\nThe county invited Winfrey to continue to lift up the community\u2019s spirit and said it appreciated her for understanding its policy \u201cof no camera crews or reporters\u201d in emergency shelters.\n\"Her visit inside of the shelter today was truly heartwarming,\" the county's Instagram said.\nFEMA is encouraging Maui County residents to register for federal assistance by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov, using the FEMA App, calling 1-800-621-3362 or visiting in person with FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance staff members.\nResidents who use relay services, such as video relay or captioned telephone service, can give FEMA operators the numbers for those services.\nHawaiian Electric laid out the protocol it abides by when high winds are expected in a statement.\nThe company \"serves 95 percent of Hawaii\u2019s 1.4 million residents on the islands of Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, Lanai and Molokai,\" according to its website.\nPart of the protocol is \"not enabling the automatic reclosure of circuits that may open during a weather event,\" which \"was done before the onset of high winds last week,\" the utility company said.\nThe company said it does not have a formal power shutoff program.\n\"Preemptive, short-notice power shutoffs have to be coordinated with first responders and in Lahaina, electricity powers the pumps that provide the water needed for firefighting,\" the statement read. \"Notifications also need to be made to customers with special medical needs who use specialized equipment.\"\nAs of this morning, 4,518 utility customers did not have power, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\"Our focus remains on supporting first responders, helping our customers and employees, and restoring power as soon as possible,\" the company said.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has been spray-painting cars and buildings on Front Street with an \u201cX\u201d to indicate they had received initial checks but that human remains could still be inside. When crews complete another pass-through, they will add the letters \u201cHR\u201d if they find remains.\nAs the death toll rises, it\u2019s unclear how morgues will accommodate the number of victims, considering there are just one hospital and three mortuaries.\nLocal residents say government agencies have blocked roads leading to the Lahaina, preventing aid and donations from getting to the devastated area.\nCassidy and Alexa Kailieha, of Oahu, said they have family in Lahaina who lost everything and don't have access to food.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just standing there blocking the road. They haven\u2019t passed out one simple water bottle, a plate of lunch, nothing,\u201d Alexa said tearfully about local agencies in Lahaina. \u201cThey\u2019re just standing there and letting our families starve and not letting us help them.\"\nThe Kailiehas said they know of at least six families whose homes burned down in Lahaina.\n\u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t make it, you know, like everybody\u2019s house burned down, everything burned down,\u201d Cassidy said in tears.\nTheir family can\u2019t leave Lahaina because they don\u2019t have gas, they said. If they leave, they won\u2019t be able to go back because of road closures enforced by the government.\nMeanwhile, tourists are being allowed into Lahaina and their hotel rooms to collect their stuff, they said.\n\u201cThis is just them putting them first again,\u201d Alexa said.\nThey're urging the government to open the road to Lahaina.\n\u201cI want to say to [Maui Mayor Richard] Bissen and Gov. Josh Greene: Open the road, open the road. Lahaina needs help, Lahaina needs food, Lahaina needs water,\u201d Cassidy said tearfully.\nThe Coast Guard had saved 17 people in search-and-rescue missions around Lahaina as of last night, FEMA said yesterday on X, previously known as Twitter.\nSeventeen people were found in the water, and 40 more were found and helped on shore.\nWith buildings and shelter burning at a rapid rate, many have taken to the water to escape the fires but have faced rough seas, heavy smoke and poor visibility.\nTwo canine search teams from Los Angeles County are expected to leave for Maui this morning to assist with recovery efforts.\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said the department was sending its strength and support to Hawaii as two of its dogs, department paramedics and a fire captain prepared to leave for Maui.\n\"The LACoFD sends our heartfelt condolences and prayers to the families who have lost loved ones; to the injured; and to all who have been displaced, lost homes, and businesses due to the wildfires that have ravaged the beautiful island of Maui,\" Marrone said.\nCORRECTION (Aug. 13, 2023, 6:15 p.m. ET): A previous version of this post misstated which agency is sending canine units to Maui. It is the Los Angeles County Fire Department, not the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nThree law firms filed a class-action suit yesterday against Hawaiian Electric, alleging that the destruction \"could have been avoided\" if the utility company had de-energized its power lines before the high-wind weather.\nOfficials have not identified the source of the wildfire, though Hawaii Gov. Josh Green noted that dry conditions followed by hurricane-level winds contributed to the spread.\nThe suit, filed on behalf of the wildfire victims, alleges that a downed power line had been reported Tuesday at a Hawaiian Electric power substation. The area is also near the site of an \"initial three-acre fire\" that day, the suit said.\nJim Kelly, a spokesperson for Hawaiian Electric, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.\n\u201cOur immediate focus is on supporting emergency response efforts on Maui and restoring power for our customers and communities as quickly as possible,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"At this early stage, the cause of the fire has not been determined and we will work with the state and county as they conduct their review.\u201d\nCORRECTION (Aug. 13, 2023, 6:15 p.m. ET): A previous version of this post misstated the power company\u2019s name. It is Hawaiian Electric, not Hawaii Electric.\nEmergency efforts to get essentials to displaced Hawaii residents are underway across the island.\nIn addition to food and clothing, the Lahaina Gateway Center has a tanker of potable water as a water advisory remains in place for Upper Kula and Lahaina.\n\"West Maui residents have requested coolers, slippers, underwear, flashlights and generators,\" the county said in a news release.\nDonated Wi-Fi trucks where people can also charge their devices will be at Napili Park and Honokowai Park free of charge.\nVolunteers opened a Department of Motor Vehicles office to help reissue driver's licenses and state identification cards to roughly 180 people staying in emergency evacuation centers. The fees were waived, and evacuees were taken to the office free of charge on Transportation Department buses.\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said today on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that she walked through Lahaina with the Federal Emergency Management Agency yesterday to see the extent of the loss firsthand.\nHirono said that as she walked through the destroyed town, she passed a line of charred cars by the ocean where it was clear the occupants had fled quickly \u2014 most likely into the water.\n\u201cWe are in a period of mourning and loss,\u201d Hirono said.\nShe said the attorney general had launched a review into why no warning sirens alerted people to the danger and allowed them to flee before wildfires quickly consumed the town.\nHirono said the tragedy showed that Hawaii has just as much of a wildfire threat as Western states and that more attention needs to be paid to wildfire prevention on the island.\n\u201cThere is not enough recognition that we are going to have to combat these kinds of wildfires,\u201d she said.\nAloha Tower will be illuminated in Maui's official color, pink, in a show of mourning for those lost in the wildfires, the state Transportation Department announced.\nGov. Josh Green ordered the national and state flags to be lowered half-staff across the state Thursday, the transportatio authority said on X, the social media app formerly known as Twitter.\nBuilt in 1926 as a lighthouse, Aloha Tower welcomed thousands of immigrants to Honolulu, as the Statue of Liberty did in New York, until it was retired in the 1960s.\nAt 184 feet, it was once the tallest structure in the state's capital, until the midcentury expansion of corporate and tourist development brought high-rise hotels to the surrounding area.\nAt least two of the 93 people killed in the fire have been identified, said Maui County officials, who did not disclose their names.\nIdentifying those who died is only the first step in what is likely to be a long process. Maui Police Chief John Pelletier said yesterday that only 3% of the search and recovery area had been covered so far.\nHuman remains are also found in a delicate condition, Pelletier told reporters.\n\"When we pick up the remains and they fall apart \u2014 so we have 200 people running through the scene yesterday, and some of you, that\u2019s what you\u2019re stepping on,\u201d Pelletier said. \u201cI don't know how else you'd like me to describe it. ... Give us a little bit of time.\"\nA chronic housing shortage and an influx of second-home buyers and wealthy transplants were displacing residents in Lahaina before the fire, and now some are concerned that any homes rebuilt there will be targeted at affluent outsiders.\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned of big land developers coming in and seeing this charred land as an opportunity to rebuild,\u201d Richy Palalay said yesterday at a shelter for evacuees.\nSterling Higa, the executive director of Housing Hawaii\u2019s Future, a nonprofit organization that advocates for more housing in Hawaii, said the town is host to many houses that have been in the hands of local families for generations. But it\u2019s also been subject to gentrification, he said, and a modest starter home two decades ago now sells for $1 million.\n\u201cSo a lot of more recent arrivals \u2014 typically from the American mainland who have more money and can buy homes at a higher price \u2014 were to some extent displacing local families in Lahaina,\u201d Higa said.\nA large banyan tree in the heart of Old Lahaina was badly scorched by fire, but it remains standing and may survive, county officials said Saturday.\nEnvironmental workers told Gov. Josh Green in a video posted to X (formerly Twitter) that dead branches and foliage on the tree could act as protection and shade as it tries to generate new buds and life.\nVideo and photographs showed that while buildings surrounding the sprawling tree \u2014 which stands at more than 60 feet and is anchored by multiple trunks spanning an acre \u2014 were destroyed by fire, wooden benches in its shade survived.\nFor 150 years, the colossal tree has shaded community events, including art fairs, shading townsfolk and tourists alike from the Hawaiian sun. Planted in 1873, it was a gift shipped from India to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first Protestant mission in Lahaina, a quarter-century before the Hawaiian Islands became a U.S. territory.\nA total of 4,509 utility customers did not have power on Maui this morning, according to Poweroutage.us. It\u2019s not clear how many live in Lahaina.\nMaui County said in an update that power was being restored in some areas that had allowed a few gas stations to reopen.\nFirefighting crews continue to extinguish flare-ups in the Lahaina and Upcountry Maui fires, officials said early Sunday.\nThree structures in Olinda and 16 in Kula were destroyed in the Upcountry Maui fire, Maui County said in an update.\nThe update said the Pulehu/K\u012bhei fire was declared 100% contained yesterday, indicating \u201cwhat percentage of the fire perimeter has been enclosed by a control line\u201d and reflecting \u201copportunities for the fire to spread beyond its original border into new areas.\u201d\nResidents in Lahaina and the largely rural area of Upper Kula have been advised that tap water remains unsafe and they should not drink or boil it.\nThe Department of Water Supply said in a statement issued by Maui County that an unsafe water notice remained out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d pending testing in those areas.\nCounty officials warned earlier that contaminants, including benzene and other volatile organic chemicals, might have entered the Lahaina water system and that fire had destroyed some water structures.\nThe death toll has increased to 93, Maui County said in statement today. Two bodies have been identified, it said.\nHawaii Gov.  Josh Green warned at a news conference yesterday that search and recovery operations were likely to turn up more remains in the fire-scorched communities in West Maui.\nThe devastation resulting from a complex of fires on Maui that started Tuesday represents the deadliest U.S. fire in recent years, U.S. Fire Administrator Lori Moore-Merrell said.\n\u201cThis fire now has become the deadliest in the last 10 years,\u201d she announced at a news conference yesterday convened by Gov. Josh Green.\nThe Maui complex of fires also represents the deadliest U.S. fire in the last 100 years. California\u2019s Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 85, previously held that title.\nOfficials warned that the death toll would continue to climb as search and recovery teams planned to cover more ground in coming days.\nMaui Police Chief John Pelletier braced the public yesterday for more devastation in West Maui because the search, recovery and identification process remains in its earliest stage.\nHe said at a news conference that no identities for the deceased have been completed in a process that can include rapid DNA testing, dental record comparisons and informing family members.\n\u201cEvery one of these 89 are John and Jane Does,\u201d Pelletier said, adding that the death toll would increase and that it was unclear where it will end up.\n\u201cNone of us really knows the size of it yet,\u201d Pelletier said. \u201cYou want it fast, or you want it right? We\u2019re going to do it right.\u201d\nGov. Josh Green said yesterday that strong midweek winds may have made the fires on Maui unstoppable.\nAs questions grow about state and local officials\u2019 initial responses to the nascent blazes Tuesday, Green pointed to a culprit hard to tame in any circumstance: trade winds boosted by a high-pressure system.\n\u201cThe largest force in play that night were 80 mph winds,\u201d Green said at a news conference about the fires and their aftermath. \u201cFortunately, now those winds have passed.\u201d\nGreen suggested that the winds\u2019 sudden and insurmountable force would have whipped hungry flames through West Maui regardless of the human reaction. \u201cHaving seen that storm, we have doubts that much could have been done with a fast-moving fire like that,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Coverage on this live blog has ended. Please click here for the latest updates.\nThe number of confirmed dead following devastating wildfires on Maui rose Monday to 99, but searchers and cadaver dogs have covered only around a quarter of the town of Lahaina, officials said.\nThat number is almost certain to rise, in what is being called the largest natural disaster in the history of Hawaii as a U.S. state.\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green said that \u201cthere has been a great deal of water conflict on Maui for many years\u201d and that Maui has faced challenges getting enough water to rural areas and to houses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of a comprehensive review that I\u2019ve asked our attorney general to do, and there will be multiple reviews at every level to find out what the level of preparedness was,\u201d Green said.\nOfficials expect to begin identifying those killed Tuesday, if their families have been notified.\nThe economic damage and cost from the Maui wildfires could be up to $7 billion, Moody\u2019s Analytics said in an initial estimate released today.\nThe price tag was called \u201castronomical\u201d in the analysis by Adam Kamins and Katie Nied.\n\u201cLosses may be more than enough to suggest a brief but severe local recession,\u201d it says.\nThe initial estimate is between $3.5 billion to $7 billion in total economic cost, with most of that from losses, the analysis says. Up to $1 billion could be in lost output, it says.\nMAALAEA HARBOR, Hawaii \u2014 The wind-fueled wildfire that swept into Lahaina \u201clooked like Armageddon,\u201d Maui firefighter Aina Kohler said.\n\u201cEverything happened so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cThe winds were the highest I\u2019ve ever felt on Maui, in my life or anywhere in my life. And everything just happened so fast.\u201d\nPart of what went wrong in the fire that erupted Tuesday and devastated the town of around 12,000 in West Maui was a lack of a crucial resource: Water.\n\u201cWe ran out of water,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re on an island, with a limited supply. And that\u2019s what we all talk about all the time, our limited resources.\u201d\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green said that \u201cthere has been a great deal of water conflict on Maui for many years\u201d and that Maui has faced challenges getting enough water to rural areas and to houses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of a comprehensive review that I\u2019ve asked our attorney general to do, and there will be multiple reviews at every level to find out what the level of preparedness was,\u201d Green said.\nQuestions have also been raised about why warning sirens did not sound.\nThe Maui Humane Society is sending all its dogs and cats to the mainland to make room for pets missing and scattered, an official said.\nSo far1, 12 of the 52 live animals that have been received since the fire Tuesday are hospitalized with injuries, the humane society's veterinary services director, Kelly Maguire, said at a news conference today.\nAn estimated 3,000 animals are missing, she said, and there have been many reports of animals in the outskirts of the fire area. Food and water are being placed out for them in the hope they can be trapped and saved, she said.\nOfficials have reunited eight animals with their owners, she said.\nShelters are being cleared to make room, Maguire said. The 150 cats and kittens that were in the shelter before the fire are being sent to the mainland, she said, and arrangements are being made for 115 dogs. The dogs are with foster families.\nTomorrow, police in Maui will start releasing the names of those killed in the wildfire that struck the Lahaina area if their families have been notified.\nMaui Police Chief John Pelletier today urged patience and respect, warning that if people trespass in burned areas they could be disturbing remains of the dead. One person was arrested for trespassing today, he said.\n\u201cI understand that people want numbers. It\u2019s not a numbers game. Right now we\u2019re at 99 souls and families,\u201d Pelletier said.\nAs of today, 25% of the area has been searched, he said. Twenty dogs are working the area.\nAround 86% of the more than 2,200 structures that were destroyed in the Maui wildfires are residential, Gov. Josh Green said today.\nHe said that housing for the displaced has been a priority and that people have taken survivors to their personal homes.\nGreen asked for patience from the people of the devastated town of Lahaina who want to return because cadaver dogs and searchers are looking for human remains.\n\u201cWe know that it\u2019s frustrating, but this pace will accelerate,\u201d Green said, including reopening of the road.\nOfficials have said areas in the burn zone are toxic and dangerous.\nThe confirmed number of deaths in the Maui wildfires has risen to 99, Gov. Josh Green said today.\n\u201cIn addition to that, the search goes on,\u201d Green said.\nState and local officials acknowledged minor backups and bottlenecks as the world responds to the Hawaii fires with tons of donated goods.\nMaui was getting 60 to 70 shipping containers filled with donations every day, making sorting and distributing to those most in need a difficult task, Laksmi Abraham of the Maui County mayor's office said.\nLt. Gov. Sylvia Luke said at a news conference today announcing a new, coordinated effort to coordinate donations: \"There has been such an outpouring of support from around the world. Some of the frustration you\u2019re hearing is because of the lack of coordinated effort.\"\nThe website Maui Nui Strong will serve as a voice for survivors, officials announced. It will be able to weigh in about what goods they most need, they said.\nSo far, officials said, residents were asking for nonperishable protein food products, bottled water, hand-washing stations, tents and battery-based chargers for electronic devices.\nAs part of the effort to better coordinate donations, a central drop-off location was being moved from the War Memorial Complex in Wailuku to the Sears building in Kahului, officials said. Key nonprofit groups were identified as participants in the distribution effort: They include the Hawaii Community Foundation, the Maui United Way and the Hawaii Food Bank.\nOfficials hope the reorganized effort will ensure donations do not go unused.\n\"We need to centralize locations where donations are going to so we can more properly distribute them to the community,\" Abraham said.\nNearly a week after Maui was ravaged by the deadliest wildfires in more than a century and as residents continue to wait for word about their missing loved ones, a new set of problems has emerged: looters and speculators trying to cash in on the tragedy.\nA local businessman said people desperate for gas and other scarce items are raiding the few businesses still standing in Lahaina, the historic city that was all but destroyed.\nBryan Sizemore, 48, a commercial sport fisherman and mechanical engineer who has lived on Maui for nearly 20 years, said he recently chased off several looters from his business at gunpoint.\n\u201cMy boat exploded as a result of the flames, but my business somehow made it. But there\u2019s been looters at my place, people stealing gas,\u201d Sizemore said today. \u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping there in my car. ... They\u2019re poking holes into the gas tanks and draining them off.\u201d\nUnited Airlines said today it and its customers have donated nearly half a million dollars and 43 million award miles to aid and disaster relief organizations focused on Maui.\nIt also said it has flown more than 11,000 people who left the island and transported workers and volunteers from the American Red Cross, World Central Kitchen and Airlink, a nonprofit group that provides free flights to disaster response groups.\nAlso today, T-Mobile announced it set up portable satellite dishes in Kaanapali and Haleakala to temporarily restore service in those areas.\nMore equipment was expected to arrive later in the day, T-Mobile said, and it would be used to help restore service along the West Maui coastline.\nThe wireless company said customers with Maui addresses who don't have the company's unlimited talk, text and data upgrade are getting it free through Aug. 21.\nCustomers can easily donate $10 to organizations helping with recovery and relief in Maui through T-Mobile's \"text-to-give\" option, it said.\nThe American Red Cross (text HAWAII to 90999), the Hawaii Community Foundation (text WILDFIRES to 501501), the Salvation Army (text WILDFIRES to 52000) and the Information Technology Disaster Resource Center (text CONNECT to 20222) are the latest options for recipients, T-Mobile said.\nIn an \"urgent travel alert\" today, the Maui Visitors Bureau said leisure travel to West Maui is \"strongly discouraged.\"\n\"The collective resources of the government, the West Maui community, and the travel industry must be focused on the recovery,\" it said.\nThe bureau, part of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, said would-be travelers can help recovery operations not only by staying away, but also by donating to local relief efforts.\nHowever, it noted that travel to Kaua\u02bbi, O\u02bbahu, L\u0101na\u02bbi and the Big Island was not affected.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said the federal government currently has the \u201cright amount of personnel on the ground\u201d in Hawaii to help in the recovery and response efforts from what has become the deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history.\nCriswell, who joined Monday\u2019s White House press briefing via video from Hawaii, said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is focused on getting people critical needs assistance funds, which provides $700 initially for food, water, medical supplies and other needs.\n\u201cWe know and have let them know that we are mourning with them,\u201d Criswell said of her work with Hawaiians. \u201cNothing can prepare you for what I saw during my time here, and nothing to prepare them for the emotional toll of the impact that the severe event has taken on them.\u201d\nAuthorities have searched 20% of the fire-ravaged area in Maui, Police Chief John Pelletier said.\nOver the weekend, Pelletier said the search, which is being conducted with dogs, was going slowly because the animals were getting tired from the heat and rough terrain. At that point, only 3% had been covered.\n\u201cYou can only work as well as the dog will work,\u201d he said.\nAmeriCorps, the national service agency established under President Bill Clinton, said it's prepared to supplement the wildfires response in Maui and help rebuild infrastructure, businesses and homes.\n\"While all AmeriCorps deployments come at the request of local governments, we are poised and ready to deploy AmeriCorps Disaster Response Teams,\" the agency said in a statement.\nAmeriCorps said it is monitoring the situation on Maui, where the fires-related death toll stood at 96 Monday.\n\"More than 8,000 residents of Hawaii have served with us,\" it said. \"We are prepared and ready to provide any assistance we are able as they respond, recover, and rebuild in the days, months, and years ahead.\"\nThe National Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard are assisting with recovery efforts in the communities reeling from fires in Maui, a Defense Department spokesman, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, said today.\nHowever, no active-duty forces are involved yet, Ryder said. That raises questions as to why not \u2014 Hawaii is home to tens of thousands of active-duty military personnel, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and major Navy and Air Force installations, with ships and aircraft that could assist in flying in supplies or personnel.\nRyder said those forces are ready to provide whatever support is requested by Hawaii but that rushing in resources too quickly could create additional logistics problems for rescue operations on the ground.\nThe multiagency fire response has already been stymied by logistical issues and communication challenges, particularly during evacuations when sirens failed to sound and roadblocks hindered residents from leaving.\n\u201cIndo-Pacom is on a hair trigger to be able to support as necessary,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cEveryone fully understands the pain that people are experiencing right now. We want to do everything we can help. But we also don\u2019t want to contribute to the problem by sending unnecessary capabilities that then will hinder any type of emergency response.\u201d\nSo far 250 Hawaii Army National Guard and Air National Guard members are assisting recovery operations, Army National Guard helicopters have dropped more than 189,000 gallons of water on the wildfires, the Army Corps of Engineers has sent debris removal teams and power experts, and the Army Reserve has provided space to collect and distribute supplies, Ryder said.\nKULA, Hawaii \u2014 Gayle and Ross Hart, a couple in their 70s, did their best to fight the Upcountry fire, which consumed their home \u2014 until the water pressure gave out and they had no choice but to leave.\nShe said that the fire crossed a gulch near their home last Tuesday and that despite firemen patrolling the area and the electric company cutting off power, the fire still entered the neighborhood.\nGayle recounted how kindhearted neighbors banded together to help the couple try to put out the fire when it encroached on their home but had to give up when the water stopped running.\n\u201cIt just disappeared \u2014 like, we just ran out of water,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy husband, I give him credit, he fought the battle until the end. He left about 11 at night. That\u2019s when the water went out and he had to go.\u201d\nShe said the blaze in her neighborhood started around 11 a.m. Hours later, around 4 to 5 p.m., she got a text to evacuate. They were able to escape with a small bag of clothing, some family pictures and a few other personal items.\n\u201cAll my recipes stayed, family heirlooms \u2014 stuff from grandparents and stuff \u2014 that\u2019s all gone,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a lot more than the people in Lahaina. There was no warning there; it just came.\u201d\nAsked about government accountability and whether residents should have been better forewarned, she said: \"Now\u2019s not the time to nitpick at what happened. It\u2019s so raw \u2014 the deaths, especially in Lahaina.\"\nDespite the heartbreak of losing her home, Gayle is keeping a positive perspective.\n\u201cLife is still good in spite of all of this. Just gotta change my direction,\u201d she said.\nActor Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who is Samoan and spent part of his childhood in Hawaii, said he is \"heartbroken\" by the wildfires that have ravaged Maui.\n\u201cI know that by now all of you around the world have seen the complete destruction and devastation that has hit our Hawaiian islands, our island of Maui. And I am completely heartbroken over this and I know you all of you are, too,\" he said Sunday in a video on Instagram.\n\"Thank you guys around the world for all of your love and support, your light, your prayers. Thank you for sending them to the island of Hawaii, the people of Hawaii,\" he said.\nHe encouraged his 388 million followers to donate to help displaced victims, noting that he has been speaking to organizations on the ground.\nIn his caption, he wrote: \u201cAll our local families, our ohana, our aiga, stay strong thru this devastating time. Resilience resolve is in our DNA. Our ancestors are in our blood. This is who we are. This is what we do. I love you. Stay strong.\u201d\nThe National Weather Service had warned for days of high winds and a \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201cdangerous fire weather scenario\u201d ahead of the wildfires that erupted on Hawaii.\nThe most significant of the blazes, which exploded in Lahaina on Maui, ignited last Tuesday.\nNearly one week before, on Aug. 2, the weather service office in Honolulu warned of dry conditions and potentially strong easterly trade winds as Hurricane Dora entered the central Pacific on a westward track.\nBy Thursday, Aug. 3, the agency warned \u201ccritical fire weather conditions are... a real concern.\u201d\nThe next day, the office warned a fire weather watch would soon be issued to highlight the threat as winds from Hurricane Dora were expected to come in, the Keetch Byram Drought Index was forecast to reach \u201cthe critical 600 mark,\u201d and leeward relative humidity was forecast to fall below 45%.\nBy Sunday, Aug. 6, the agency set a fire weather watch for Monday and Tuesday, Aug. 7-8, for leeward parts of the island, \u201cwhere critical fire conditions are most likely to develop.\u201d\nThe agency warned Sunday that \u201calong with strong winds, very dry air will also be moving into the region, creating significant fire weather concerns as well.\u201d\nBy Monday the 7th, a high wind warning and a red flag warning \u2014 meaning extreme fire behavior was possible \u2014 were in place.\nAs blazes burned in different areas of Maui that day, the red flag warning was extended to 6 a.m. Wednesday because of the continued dry conditions, low humidity and strong and gusty easterly winds.\nA Facebook post from St. Anthony Maui Parish showed the church still standing amid the destruction of the wildfires.\nJason Momoa is delivering a stern message to tourists who plan to visit Maui during the deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history.\nMomoa, 44, a Hawaii native who has been using social media to help with rescue and fundraising efforts, posted his warning Friday on Instagram.\n\u201cMaui is not the place to have your vacation right now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDO NOT TRAVEL TO MAUI.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cDo not convince yourself that your presence is needed on an island that is suffering this deeply.\u201d\nHe also thanked everyone who has been sending donations and love to the community as it is being devastated by raging fires.\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green will hold a wildfires news briefing at 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 p.m. ET), his office said.\nNearly a week since wildfires erupted on Maui, cell service is slowly returning to the island.\nVerizon Wireless said service was restored along Highway 37 in Ulupalakua and Keokea and to the Upcountry. Partial service was restored to part of West Maui.\nVerizon said that there is \u201csignificant\u201d structural damage to cell sites serving Lahaina and that engineers are working to move a mobile cell site to restore partial service. More disaster response engineers landed Sunday in Maui.\nMeanwhile, AT&T said it restored a cell site in north Kaanapali using a portable satellite, and an AT&T drone operations pilot is on Maui to assess any damage to cell sites using a camera drone.\nT-Mobile\u2019s emergency teams are also working to restore connectivity in Maui. Over the weekend, the company said it restored connection to sites in Kaanapali and Haleakal\u0101, \u201cwith teams continuing to evaluate impacted sites.\u201d\n\u201cThe team deployed generators and VSATs (Very Small Aperture Terminals) \u2014 portable satellite solutions \u2014 to restore connectivity where the fire damaged local fiber connections and commercial power outages are impacting permanent cell sites,\u201d the company said in an update Monday. \u201cAdditional microwave and satellite equipment is expected to arrive in Maui today, and the team is focused on providing connectivity to Maui\u2019s west coast.\u201d\nJeremy Greenberg, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Office of Response and Recovery, shared a breakdown of what has been done so far in Maui.\n\u201cFEMA has a permanent logistics distribution center in Hawaii and immediately after the incident occurred, started moving commodities such as food and water, protective masks, shelter equipment into Maui to support the state of Hawaii,\u201d he said today on MSNBC.\nFEMA has over 250 personnel on the ground, with 50 to 60 working in shelters and with survivors to register them for FEMA assistance, he said, which will help those who have lost their homes.\n\u201cI know that this is just the first step in a difficult recovery process,\u201d Greenberg said.\nHe said the fast-moving nature of the blazes that erupted at the late hour posed challenges for first responders.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a long-term recovery aspect to this certainly, but that\u2019s why FEMA and the entire federal government are working with the state to prioritize getting everyone who\u2019s impacted by this the assistance they need.\u201d\nFor FEMA Assistance, contact (800) 621-3362 or go to FEMA\u2019s website.\nTeams of cadaver dogs have surveyed just 3% of the area to be searched on devastated Maui, Police Chief John Pelletier has said.\nAt a news conference over the weekend, Pelletier said, \u201c3%, that\u2019s what\u2019s been searched with the dogs, 3%,\" referring to search teams with cadaver dogs that arrived Saturday in Maui and were scouring the areas devastated by last week\u2019s wildfires.\n\u201cFor the first few days, we had done searches of the streets and the cars in the area, but we couldn\u2019t enter any structures,\u201d Pelletier told NBC News. \u201cMy police officers are trained to go chase bad guys, respond to robberies, take reports. But they are not trained to enter shouldering structures to go look for human remains.\u201d\nHawaii officials say the best way to assist Maui wildfire victims is to donate money.\nGov. Josh Green shared a link to donations to the foundation\u2019s \u201cMaui Strong\u201d fund Thursday. The fund aims to provide community resilience with resources for disaster preparedness, response and recovery.\nThe American Red Cross\u2019s donations will help those displaced by the wildfire find safe shelters where they can get information and hot meals, charge their phones, pick up relief supplies and get health services.\nAloha United Way, a nonprofit organization based in Honolulu, has created the Maui Fire Relief Fund, with donations going directly toward efforts that support victims of the fires.\nThe Maui Humane Society is accepting donations on its website and on Facebook to help feed and care for displaced pets, many of whom need medical treatment.\nA Kaanapali resident said overnight that basic supplies remain lacking and not much had improved over the weekend.\nShe said a low-flying airplane with a loudspeaker notified residents yesterday that a market had reopened.\nResidents have been running supply deliveries to a local beach using boats and jet skis, but they, too, are quickly snapped up.\n\u201cThe majority came from within our island, and it looks like we have a lot one minute and then poof it\u2019s all gone,\u201d Leon said. \u201cWe\u2019re rationing so that we have enough till tomorrow.\u201d\nStill, her spirit remained bright. \"I have never seen in my lifetime of 54 years such an amazing group of people \u2014 our Ohana \u2014 pooling together and sharing their last food or water or medicine to help a stranger. The other islands have also come to our rescue and keep coming,\" she said.\nA 73-year-old resident said her face and arm were burned when she frantically escaped the wildfires that tore through Maui last week.\nShe told NBC's Tom Llamas in an interview this morning on \"TODAY\" that she got no kind of alert to evacuate when the flames tore through her area.\nNow she's searching for her brother, who is still missing.\n\u201cI\u2019m so worried about everybody. Hopefully he\u2019s still alive,\" she said.\nThe death toll is only expected to mount as just 3% of Lahaina has been searched, with much of the operation first focused on streets and cars in the area.\nNoah Tomkinson, 19, and his 13-year-old brother, Milo, spent hours in the water with their mother escaping the flames.\nHarrowing video show his family in the ocean not far from the shore i fierce winds. Orange flames can be seen not so far away on land, and the sky is filled with black smoke.\nTomkinson said they focused on keeping their mother warm as they waited for the blaze to die down.\n\u201cWe kind of, like, all huddled around her and just wanted to keep her warm,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any of us were alone, I don't know if we would have made it.\u201d\nRetired Maj. Jeff Hickman, a spokesperson for Hawaii\u2019s Department of Defense, said this morning on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show that search-and-response efforts are ramping up and that Maui will soon be heading into the recovery phase \u2014 \u201cand that\u2019s going to be the longest phase yet.\u201d\nHe said the number of casualties is likely to rise above the latest count of 96.\n\u201cWe only have 3% of the search done, and they want to be meticulous and do it right. So right now they\u2019re going street by street and block by block. They\u2019re doing cars, and soon they\u2019ll start to enter buildings,\u201d he said.\nHickman said that the Hawaii National Guard has over 110 personnel assisting with search and rescue in Maui County and that FEMA has about 400 personnel with cadaver dogs.\n\"So the efforts are going to start to move a little faster than they have the past couple days, and hopefully we bring some closure to those on Maui,\u201d he said.\nAsked whether power should have been cut earlier to slow the rampant spread of the wildfires last week, Hickman said he couldn\u2019t comment directly, but he said an investigation would take place.\n\u201cThe governor and the state attorney general is going to have a comprehensive review on what is the cause behind this fire and what steps were taken, but right now our focus is on the priority of Maui. Right now it's the needs of the people of Maui,\u201d he said.\nA Hawaii resident said he was angry with the government for failing to activate sirens and deliver proper alarms for residents to evacuate.\n\u201cNo alarms, no warning, nothing,\u201d Rafa Ochoa told NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News,\u201d \u201cnot even police rolling by telling us to evacuation or anything.\u201d\nThe Hawaii Emergency Services Administration said Friday that no outdoor warning sirens were triggered by either Maui or Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\u201cWe\u2019re mad,\u201d Ochoa said with tears in his eyes. \u201cWe lost our homes. We lost our town. Lost history. Our kids are traumatized. You guys messed up real bad.\u201d\nMarination, one of the most popular Hawaiian restaurants in Seattle, raised around $40,000 over the weekend for people affected by the wildfires, NBC affiliate KING of Seattle reported.\nThe restaurant's co-owner Kamala Saxton said she wanted to send help to Maui after she saw the heartbreaking destruction. So she decided to sell over 3,000 Spam musubi, an iconic Hawaiian snack, at $4.75 each this weekend to raise money.\n\u201cSeeing Spam musubi almost makes you feel at home,\u201d Saxton said. \u201cThen you eat and you\u2019re like this is a piece of home. This is something that just brings you back to your childhood, back to family gatherings, back to luaus.\u201d\nShe donated all the money to Maui Rapid Response and the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, organizations supporting the front-line emergency response, KING reported.\n\u201cWe are keeping them in our thoughts,\u201d Saxton added. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to help them, and this is just the start, and it won\u2019t stop. We feel their pain, and we are with them.\u201d\nThe \u201cfire hurricane\u201d in Maui spread at the rate of 1 mile per minute and destroyed the town of Lahaina on the island, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said in a video statement yesterday.\n\u201cThere is very little left there,\u201d he said in the video, which was posted yesterday afternoon. \u201cOver 2,700 structures were destroyed in Lahaina, and an estimated value of $5.6 billion has gone away.\n\u201cBut mostly there are people [who] are suffering, and we continue to work to find them,\u201d he added.\nA fire travels at this rate mainly because of the wind gusts, which officials believe were up to 81 mph, Green said.\n\u201cWith those kinds of winds and 1,000-degree temperature, ultimately all the pictures that you will see will be easy to understand,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that level of destruction and a fire hurricane \u2014 something new to us in the age of global warming \u2014 was the ultimate reason that so many people perished.\u201d\nMost Maui schools will welcome their employees today and students on Wednesday, but West Maui schools and King Kekaulike High in Upcountry will remain closed, according to a letter yesterday from the state Education Department to students, families and employees.\n\u201cOur hearts are heavy, and the road to recovery will be long, but I have faith in our collective strength to support one another and our students,\u201d Superintendent Keith Hayashi wrote in the letter. \u201cTogether, we will heal, we will rebuild and L\u0101hain\u0101 and Maui will thrive once more.\u201d\nHayashi also said that King Kamehameha III Elementary in Lahaina was \u201cdamaged beyond repair\u201d and that the department is still looking for options for students in West Maui.\nAlthough schools in West Maui will not reopen until it is safe for students to return, the department highly encouraged students displaced by the fires to enroll in neighboring schools, albeit with temporary housing.\n\u201cWhen children are in school, we can provide support including meals and health support,\u201d Hayashi wrote.\nAround 85% of the wildfire in Lahaina has been contained, and the estimated size of the areas that have been suppressed is 2,170 acres, according to the latest update from Maui County.\nThe county also reported that 60% of the fire in the Upcountry area has been contained and that 100% of the fire in the Pulehu region has been contained.\nHowever, it also warned residents that the fire could not be declared \u201cextinguished\u201d even though it was 100% contained and that it could be declared \u201cextinguished\u201d only when the firefighters had confirmed there was nothing left to burn.\nThe news release was issued at 9:45 last night (3:45 a.m. ET today).\nPower has been restored to around 5,000 customers in West Maui and Upcountry, Hawaiian Electric said in its latest update at 1 p.m. (6 p.m. ET yesterday.\nSince Tuesday, more than 60% of its customers have been brought back online, the update said.\nMore than 300 Hawaiian Electric Co. employees and contractors are working to restore power in West Maui and Upcountry, and other employees in neighboring areas are available to help facilitate restoration, it said.\nHawaiian Electric also warned residents to be alert when they see downed power lines and to stay away from them.\nThe number of people confirmed to have died in the fires has risen to 96, according to a news release this morning from Maui County.\nThe update was as of 9:45 last night (3:45 a.m. ET today).\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green issued the fifth emergency proclamation yesterday about the wildfires.\nThe proclamation extends the disaster emergency relief period until Aug. 31.\nIt allows health workers from other states and former professionals without valid licenses (except for misconduct) to practice on Maui. It also removed the $10 million limit for the Major Disasters Fund.\nIt strongly discourages \u201call nonessential travel\u201d to West Maui during the period of the proclamation to accommodate displaced residents and emergency workers.\nThe confirmed number of people killed stands at 93 this morning as crews search the charred ruins on Maui for signs of those still missing.\nOfficials have said they expect the death toll to increase as remains are found.",

Please click here for the latest updates.\nThough the wildfires have mostly been contained, Hawaii residents are still reeling from the aftermath as families assess the devastating damage to their homes and identifications are released of some of the 106 people killed.\nPeople have begun to share stories of those killed, including a 68-year-old man who died trying to protect his dog and a family of four who burned to death in their car near their home. Identifications are likely to be released slowly over the coming days as officials recover remains and notify families.\nThose who survived are scattered across at least 11 shelters that are serving more than 4,000 people, according to the Red Cross of Hawaii. Maui residents have also told NBC News they are frustrated as they move out of shelters and into hotels, which will be available for only 30 days. Families are seeking more permanent housing options after having lost their entire lives over just a few days.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said it is on the ground in Maui working on getting temporary rental assistance, as well as providing money and aiding search efforts. President Joe Biden promised \u201cevery asset\u201d available from the federal government to help the state recover Tuesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost hollow ... \u2018our thoughts and prayers with the people\u2019 ... not just our prayers, every asset, every asset they need will be there for them,\u201d Biden said at an event in Wisconsin. \u201cAnd we will be there as long as it takes, as long as it takes.\u201d\nMaui County released the names tonight of two of the 106 victims of the wildfires.\nThe two victims were identified as Robert Dyckman, 74, and Buddy Jantoc, 79, both of Lahaina.\nThree more victims have been identified but their names are being withheld pending next of kin notification, the county said in a statement.\nThe majority of the 106 fatalities have not been identified.\n\u201cWe offer our deepest condolences to the families who are beginning to receive notifications about their loved ones,\u201d Mayor Richard Bissen said in the statement. \u201cAs a community, we offer our prayers of comfort in this most difficult time.\u201d\nWAILEA, Hawaii \u2014 One week after wildfires roared across Maui and devoured their property, residents who have called Maui home for generations were watching over the ashes.\nDistrustful of the government\u2019s response to a tragedy that has already displaced hundreds of families and fearful of outsiders\u2019 swooping in to take their ancestral homes, they were organizing their own relief efforts to get food and supplies to people who are unwilling or unable to venture far from their destroyed properties.\n\u201cWe are taking charge,\u201d Maui County Council Vice Chair Keani Rawlins-Fernandez said Tuesday.\nKIHEI, Hawaii \u2014 After the power went out in Lahaina and after smoke was seen from a wildfire that would later sweep into the town, Tasha Anderson \u201cwas in denial.\u201d\nThey had seen other storms and other fires, and they were always able to return later.\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to leave, like, where we had built the nursery, where we were going to bring our baby home to,\u201d Anderson, who is pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child, said today.\nHer fianc\u00e9, Kevin Campbell, got on a scooter to check the condition of the fire. He said what he saw was not like past experiences.\n\u201cThe flames, the wind had just taken this fire and made it so much more than a normal fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was jumping from building to building. It was crossing the street. It was catching a tree and then catching a house.\u201d\nWhen Anderson heard the panic in Campbell\u2019s voice, they got in a car and left, grabbing almost nothing.\nA 78-unit Ka Hale A Ke Ola Homeless Resource Centers shelter was among the buildings destroyed in the wildfire that burned into Lahaina, the organization said.\nKHAKO Executive Director Monique R. Ibarra said she saw the destruction firsthand with a police escort.\n\u201cAll the buildings are gone. Wildfire reduced them to ashes and debris,\u201d she said in a statement on the group\u2019s website.\n\u201cThis morning, I informed the residents who escaped Tuesday afternoon with little more than the clothes they were wearing. It was heartbreaking,\u201d she wrote.\nSome of the units were for emergency shelter for families and people making the transition from homelessness to permanent housing, the organization said.\nMany on Maui will need shelter in the wake of the destruction in Lahaina, Gov. Josh Green has said. He said over 500 hotel rooms have been identified and are available.\n\"Hundreds of families and thousands of individuals\" have lost either the residences they own or where they have been renting, Green said today.\nA major road by the fire-ravaged Lahaina area in West Maui will be reopened tonight for some groups and tomorrow during the day for everyone, the governor said.\n\u201cNo one will be able to go into the impact zone where the tragedy has occurred,\u201d Gov. Josh Green said, but he said the decision will allow freer movement in West Maui.\nThe Lahaina Bypass will be opened starting at 6 o\u2019clock tonight until 6 a.m. for residents, first responders and employees of the region, he said.\nStarting tomorrow from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., it will be opened to everyone, and that will be a regular schedule, he said.\n10 p.m. to 6 a.m. will be for necessary travel for residents and first responders, he said.\n\u201cWere trying to get back to normal so that people\u2019s lives can begin to, in some ways, be reconnected to the other side of the island,\u201d Green said.\nThe number of confirmed deaths in the wildfires in Maui that devastated the town of Lahaina has risen to 101, Gov. Josh Green said today.\nThe previous number was 99. Surveys and searches of burned areas are continuing.\nGreen said more than 1,000 first responders from around the world are assisting after the tragedy. The fire that broke out in Lahaina was one of several in Maui on Aug. 8.\n\"We are heartsick that we\u2019ve had such loss,\" Green said.\nMonstrous, windswept wildfires ripped through the Hawaiian island of Maui last week, charring communities and killing at least 100 people.\nNBC News reconstructed a timeline of events based on public advisories, state government warnings, eyewitness accounts and videos posted on social media.\nFour of the sets of remains found after Maui\u2019s wildfires have been identified, Maui County said in an update this morning Hawaii time.\nThe identities of the four will be released once their families are notified, the county said.\nInvestigators have obtained DNA profiles of 13 more people, and 41 DNA samples have been obtained from family members of people who are unaccounted for, the county said.\nRelatives who wish to provide DNA to help in the search can go to a Family Assistance Center, the county said.\nFranklin Trejos was among those killed. He died sheltering a golden retriever, longtime friends said. \"Just the friendliest guy you would ever meet,\" Shannon Weber-Bogar recalled.\nMore areas of Maui\u2019s deadly wildfire were searched today, with 32% of the disaster zone having been covered, Maui County said in an update.\nPreviously, 25% had been searched. Dogs are being used to locate remains in and around Lahaina, the West Maui town that burned when a wind-whipped fire swept in last week.\nMaui Police Chief John Pelletier said at a news conference yesterday that it is hoped that 85% to 90% can be searched by the weekend.\nIn some cases, dogs have helped find remains after initial searches have been done and searchers retraced where they had been, Pelletier said.\nNinety-nine deaths have been confirmed. The number could rise as more searches are done.\nThe Maui wildfires have forced evacuees to spend 4,000 stays in shelters so far during the ongoing disaster, officials said Tuesday.\nThose residents have been staying at 11 shelters, as more than 270 volunteers have jumped into action, according to the Red Cross of Hawaii.\n\"Our work is just beginning,\" the relief organization said. \"We\u2019re working with our partners to get help to where it is needed as quickly as possible.\"\nA United Airlines pilot vacationing on Maui volunteered to fly a plane off the wildfire-engulfed island, helping 330 people get home safely.\nCapt. Vince Eckelkamp, of Colorado, told NBC News today that he was scheduled to fly from Maui to Denver last Tuesday after a six-day vacation with his wife and daughter.\nAround 4 a.m. that morning, the power in his hotel went out due to gusty winds that downed power lines. The family packed their bags in the dark and planned to head to Kahului Airport early, but soon found there was no cell service available.\nTo get to the airport, Eckelkamp\u2019s family drove through the historic town of Lahaina \u2014 only a few hours before it turned into an inferno.\nFederal prosecutors warned the public today to be on the lookout for heartless scammers who won't \"hesitate to take advantage of the challenging times to commit fraud and other crimes.\"\nTelltale signs of a scam will include requests for personal information, such as bank account numbers and Social Security numbers, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Hawaii said in a statement.\n\"As the devastation of our communities on Maui and Hawaii Island continues to unfold, local and national organizations have created ways for volunteers to assist as well as to provide donations of food, money and other resources,\" prosecutors said.\n\"While such efforts provide critical aid, we know that during periods of tremendous need like this, criminals do not hesitate to take advantage of the challenging times to commit fraud and other crimes,\" the statement continued.\nAs Maui reckons with the deadliest wildfire in recent U.S. history, it is also dealing with a digital nightmare that has become common around major news stories: social media-fueled conspiracy theories.\nFires have ravaged and destroyed parts of West Maui, hitting the historic community of Lahania particularly hard. At least 99 people are dead and the economic cost of the fires could balloon to $7 billion.\nIt\u2019s still unclear what caused the fires, but the severity of the destruction in West Maui has been attributed in part to a confluence of high winds from Hurricane Dora in the Pacific and drought in the region. Wildfires have been a known risk in the area for years.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped would-be social media sleuths from attempting to uncover a nonexistent plot to start the fires.\nOne of the most prevalent and outlandish theories is that the fires were caused by some kind of secret \u201cenergy weapon,\u201d a relatively common conspiracy trope that has been repurposed in recent years around a variety of events, including previous wildfires. Some have misrepresented an image of a SpaceX rocket launch as evidence that some kind of weapon used a beam to cause an explosion on the island.\nPresident Joe Biden, speaking Tuesday at an event in Wisconsin, promised \u201cevery asset\u201d from the federal government in response to the Hawaii wildfires.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve claimed the lives of 99 people so far,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t cleaned things up yet. The deadliest wildfire more than 100 years, whole city destroyed. Generations of native Hawaiian history turned into ruin.\u201d\n\u201cAnd think about this, all that area. They gotta plow up,\" he continued. \"They can\u2019t do it now because you don\u2019t know how many bodies, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s left. Imagine being a mom or dad, wondering where your child is. Imagine being a husband or wife or mother, father. It\u2019s really tough stuff.\u201d\nBiden said he\u2019s spoken with Gov. Josh Green multiple times and almost 500 federal personnel have been deployed to the state. He said that he and first lady Jill Biden will travel to Hawaii as soon as possible, but don\u2019t want to disrupt rescue and recovery efforts.\n\u201cIn the meantime, you always hear this phrase and I\u2019ve done so many disasters in my career. It\u2019s almost hollow ... 'our thoughts and prayers with the people' ... not just our prayers, every asset, every asset they need will be there for them. And we will be there as long as it takes, as long as it takes.\u201d\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s the sort of split-screen moment that no White House relishes.\nWhile Maui counted its dead Sunday, President Joe Biden sat on the beach in Delaware, rode his bicycle and said little about the deadliest wildfire to hit the U.S. in a century.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at it,\u201d he said, pedaling past reporters who shouted at him as he whizzed by.\nBiden first delivered remarks about the catastrophic fires on Thursday. The next day, his son became the subject of a federal special counsel investigation. And since then, Biden has said virtually nothing to the press \u2014 not about Hunter Biden, the fires or anything else.\nFour days of silence haven\u2019t gone unnoticed. Yesterday reporters pressed White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre about why he has not spoken out more; Republicans have piled on criticism that the president was failing to address the devastation; and today the conservative media juxtaposed pictures of Biden at the beach with footage of the fires.\nParis Hilton drew criticism when photos obtained by the Daily Mail showed the star vacationing on Maui amid the wildfire catastrophe.\nA source close to Paris Hilton told NBC News that she had been on the island for a planned family trip, and Maui is like a second home for her.\n\u201cHer uncle\u2019s restaurant in Lahaina burned down, so they decided to shorten their trip and go to see their family and help where they could,\u201d the source said. \u201cWhen they arrived, they gathered supplies, donated to the local shelters and people in need, and made significant contributions.\u201d\nAn estimated 3,000 animals are believed to have been displaced by the Maui wildfires, many of them likely needing \u201cintense medical care,\u201d the Maui Humane Society said Tuesday.\nThe organization shared a photo of a cat found by rescuers; they are calling it Alani, which means the color orange in Hawaiian. Based off his scorched coat, he \u201cmade his best efforts escaping the fires.\u201d\n\u201cAll of his paw pads burned, his mouth swollen and painful. He was dehydrated and lifeless. He had no microchip or other signs of ownership,\u201d the society wrote on Facebook. For now, Alani is on the mend getting daily foot soaks to treat his paws and medications.\n\"If Alani\u2019s owners are out there, we want them to know that he is safe and recovering,\" the organization wrote. \"Maui Humane Society is dedicated to reunifying pets with their owners.\"\nShannon Weber-Bogar told NBC News her friend Franklin Trejos died shielding their 3-year-old golden retriever, Sam, in the wildfires that consumed Lahaina on Aug. 8.\nHer husband, Geoff Bogar, found the bodies of Trejos and Sam in a car one day after the blaze tore through their neighborhood.\nGeoff Bogar told The Associated Press that he and Trejos tried to save the Bogars' house and help people in the neighborhood, but fled in their own cars when the flames drew near.\nGeoff Bogar said his car wouldn\u2019t start and he broke through a window and crawled on the ground until a police patrol found him and he was taken to a hospital. When he returned the next day, he found the bones of 68-year-old Trejos, his friend of 35 years.\nTrejos, a native of Costa Rica, had lived for years with Bogar and his wife, helping her with her seizures when her husband couldn\u2019t. He filled their lives with love and laughter, The Associated Press reported.\nFaaso and Malui Fonua Tone, Salote Takafua, and her son, Tony Takafua died attempting to escape the wildfires that tore through Hawaii last week.\nTheir remains were found Thursday in a burned car near their home.\n\u201cThe magnitude of our grief is indescribable,\u201d read a statement from family members.\nLylas Kanemoto, who knew the Tone family, confirmed the devastating news Sunday.\n\u201cAt least we have closure for them, but the loss and heartbreak is unbearable for many. We as a community has to just embrace each other and support our families, friends, and our community to our best of our abilities,\u201d Kanemoto told The Associated Press by text message on Sunday.\nSince wildfires hit Hawaii last week, American Airlines operated 21 flights from Kahului Airport on Maui to the continental U.S., evacuating more than 4,200 people from the island, the airline said in an update Monday.\nAmerican also worked with nonprofits to send in shipments of supplies such as nonperishable food, baby formula and diapers to the island.\nFrom Aug. 8 to Sunday, United Airlines transported more than 11,000 people off Maui, and flew in responders with the American Red Cross, Air Link and World Central Kitchen, the airline said in a statement.\nHawaii Airlines said in the first 72 hours of the disaster, hundreds of flights were operated and carried more than 17,000 people out of Kahului Airport.\nWithin the first week, more than 54,000 pounds of essential supplies were also transported to Maui including blood, medical supplies, communications equipment and animal kennels, according to the airline.\nThe fires that have been burning in Maui since Tuesday could pose long-term health risks to residents due to chemical compounds contaminating the air, water and wreckage, authorities and experts have warned.\nThe Hawaii State Health Department cautioned Friday that ash and dust from burned buildings might carry toxic chemicals like asbestos and lead. Many destroyed buildings in Lahaina \u2014 the hardest-hit community \u2014 may have contained these chemicals because they were built before lead and asbestos were phased out of construction in the 1970s.\n\u201cThings like lead and asbestos are sort of top of the list. Those are things that are in paint, in buildings, and then do not really get destroyed with burning, so they\u2019re now in the ash and the dust,\u201d said Diana Felton, Hawaii\u2019s state toxicologist.\nFelton said that there is some concern that people in Lahaina might inhale lead and asbestos particles in the air but that the bigger worry is that residents might unintentionally ingest the chemicals if they get on clothes or hands.\nFederal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson John Mills shared an update on what the agency is doing on Maui: providing money to survivors for critical needs, temporary rental assistance, getting people out of shelters and into hotels and aiding in search and rescue efforts.\n\u201cThis is a very somber and respectful process that we\u2019re going through at the same time working across multiple lines of effort in mass care, emergency services, critical infrastructure and housing to figure out the next steps and support Maui County and support the state,\u201d Mills said on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show Tuesday morning.\nPower and cell service is slowly being restored, Mills said, but there\u2019s still a ways to go when it comes to searching charred buildings for victims.\nStill, there are glimmers of hope from the vibrant community on the island. \"Neighbors are really doing an amazing job. So many people are taking survivors into their homes and giving them a temporary place to live,\u201d he said.\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green said nearly 500 people \u201cimpacted from the fires\u201d are now being housed in hotels.\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to working with our hotel and vacation rental industries to prioritize the temporary housing needs of our people,\u201d Green tweeted Monday evening. \u201cWe mahalo them for their extraordinary efforts.\u201d\nHe shared a video of a Lahaina native named Jacob, who lost his home in the fire and works at the Royal Lahaina Resort and is being temporarily housed and fed at the hotel with his immediate family.\n\u201cMy family we were able to make it here, I\u2019ve accounted for everybody. My children, they are all good. We do have a special needs child, muscle dystrophy along with Down syndrome but due to the outreach and all the help and support we\u2019ve been getting from clinics from his therapy sessions, all that, he\u2019s doing just fine,\" Jacob said in the clip. \"We\u2019re just so grateful for everything everyone has done and please continue to support,\" he added.\nThe death toll of the Maui wildfire disaster remained at 99 as of late Monday evening local time, officials said.\nAt least three people killed in the wildfires had so far been identified as of 10 p.m. local time (4 a.m. ET Tuesday) Maui County officials said in an online update.\n\"Their names will be released after their families are notified,\" the county said.\nThe fire in Lahaina was around 85 percent contained as of late Monday evening local time, officials said.\nIn an update on the wildfire disaster, Maui County said that as of 10 p.m. local time on Monday (4 a.m. ET on Tuesday) the fire had been at least 85 percent contained.\n\"Multiple fire crews are assigned to monitor and address any flareups,\" the county said, adding: \"There are no active threats at this time.\"\nThe county noted that even when a fire is 100 percent contained, that does not mean it has been extinguished. \"It means that firefighters have the blaze fully surrounded by a perimeter, inside which it can still burn. A fire is declared 'extinguished' when fire personnel believe there is nothing left burning.\"\nFormer Golden State Warriors coach Don Nelson is reportedly opening his short-term rental homes in Maui to those impacted by the deadly wildfires.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the best we can, but we only have space for about 24 people,\u201d Nelson told the San Francisco Chronicle in a phone interview Monday. \u201cThere are thousands of people homeless right now. It\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d\nNelson started investing in local real estate in Maui back in 2011 shortly after settling into West Maui full-time, according to the outlet. Now, he said he is leasing his properties for free to those who have lost their homes in the wildfire.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThis is home. Right now, it needs all our help.\u201d\nThe Japanese government is ready to \"provide necessary assistance\" in response to the wildfires if the U.S. requests it, a spokesperson said Tuesday.\nJapan has so far received reports of homes owned by Japanese nationals being damaged by the wildfires in Maui, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said in a daily news briefing. He said the government had not received any news of fatalities or injuries among Japanese nationals.\n\u201cSince the outbreak of the wildfire, we have been in close communication with the U.S. government as well as the Hawaiian state government, and we have informed them of our readiness to provide necessary assistance should they request it,\" he said.\nThe economic cost to Maui from the wildfires could come up to $7 billion, Moody\u2019s Analytics said Monday.\n\"Losses may be more than enough to suggest a brief but severe local recession,\" the financial services company said.\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green also said that the damage was estimated to be close to $6 billion.\nHe said \u201cthere has been a great deal of water conflict on Maui for many years\u201d and that Maui has faced challenges getting enough water to rural areas and to houses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of a comprehensive review that I\u2019ve asked our attorney general to do, and there will be multiple reviews at every level to find out what the level of preparedness was,\u201d Green said.\nThe search for those missing in the Maui wildfires will continue on Tuesday after the death toll rose to nearly 100 people.\nAt least 99 people were confirmed to have died in the wildfires, officials said Monday. Officials were expected to begin identifying those killed on Tuesday, provided that their families have been notified of their deaths.\nSearchers and cadaver dogs had so far covered around a quarter of the town of Lahaina as of Monday, officials said. They will continue their search in what Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said was likely to be the largest natural disaster in the state's history.",

Wildfires have been a known risk in the area for years.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped would-be social media sleuths from attempting to uncover a nonexistent plot to start the fires.\nOne of the most prevalent and outlandish theories is that the fires were caused by some kind of secret \u201cenergy weapon,\u201d a relatively common conspiracy trope that has been repurposed in recent years around a variety of events, including previous wildfires. Some have misrepresented an image of a SpaceX rocket launch as evidence that some kind of weapon used a beam to cause an explosion on the island.\nThose baseless theories rely on images of a SpaceX launch that took place in May 2018 in California.\nThe Associated Press reported that these images are being shared on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, and, in one instance, a man on Instagram shared the image claiming it \u201cshows a laser beam coming out of the sky directly targeting the city.\u201d He then falsely claims the Maui wildfires are linked to a long-running conspiracy theory about a weaponized government weather modification program, The AP reported.\nThe conspiracies aren\u2019t limited to Meta platforms and have also popped up on apps like X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok.\nMeta, X and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTikTok says it \u201cprohibit[s] content that could mislead our community about civic processes, public health, or safety.\u201d Meta says it removes \u201cmisinformation where it is likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm. We also remove content that is likely to directly contribute to interference with the functioning of political processes and certain highly deceptive manipulated media.\u201d\nAn August 2022 policy from X said it \u201cwill take action on accounts that use X\u2019s services to share false or misleading information that could bring harm to crisis-affected populations.\u201d It was unclear if that policy was still in place.\nAnother conspiracy about an energy weapon, this one predominantly spreading on X, showed an image that some incorrectly claimed was Maui. In reality, the image shows a flare set off during a controlled burn in Canton, Ohio \u2014 also in 2018.\nBoth the fact-checking website Snopes and The AP have debunked the images as being from SpaceX and the controlled burn in Ohio.\nSocial media conspiracies around the Maui fires are hardly the first time internet sleuths have seized on a disaster to spread false claims.\nAfter smog from a Canadian wildfire covered the Northeast this summer, false conspiracies about the fires\u2019 origin percolated online. Far-right conspiracy theorists seized on the same theory in connection with Maui\u2019s fire, falsely claiming the U.S. government had used a targeted \u201cenergy weapon\u201d to start the burn in Canada.\nWhen a train derailed on Feb. 3 in East Palestine, Ohio, containing the highly flammable and toxic chemical vinyl chloride, conspiracies took over social media about acid rain spreading to the East Coast. That theory was debunked by officials in several states, including New York, who said that there had been no uptick in rain acidity following the derailment. Experts also added that hydrochloric acid, which is the byproduct of vinyl chloride when it  is burned, does not typically get picked up by air currents or create acid rain.\nOther major newsworthy events, like the pandemic and mass shootings, have also been plagued by social media conspiracies.\nKalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.",

Please click here for the latest updates.\nTropical storm warnings extended into Southern California Friday night as Hurricane Hilary, which has been bringing winds and rain to Mexico, approaches the United States.\nIt\u2019s expected to weaken and become a tropical storm by the time it reaches Southern California, which is forecast to occur by Sunday night.\nThe storm will bring high winds, up to around 50 mph, but rain and flooding are chief concerns, according to the forecasters.\nOfficials in Los Angeles, San Diego and other places urged people to take the storm seriously, and to be prepared for flooding and power outages.\n\u201cThis is real,\u201d Chris Heiser, executive director for the San Diego Office of Emergency Services, said at a news conference.\n\u201cThis is not like the other storms we\u2019ve experienced. It\u2019s a huge footprint, it goes all the way from the desert out into the ocean,\u201d he said.\nLas Vegas and other parts of Nevada also face possible floods, and the governor activated 100 members of the National Guard to assist impacted areas.\nNaval ships and submarines based in the San Diego area will head to sea until the storm passes, the Navy announced tonight.\nThe commander of the U.S. 3rd Fleet set \u201cSortie Condition Alpha\u201d today and San Diego-based ships will get underway tomorrow, the Navy said in a statement.\n\u201cIn order to ensure the safety of our Sailors and ships, we are taking all necessary measures to mitigate potential damage to infrastructure and Third Fleet vessels caused by the storm,\u201d said Vice Adm. Michael Boyle, commander, U.S. 3rd Fleet. \u201cSafety remains our top priority, and putting all capable ships to sea makes it easier for us to manage the situation ashore,\u201d he added.\nShips and submarines from Naval Base San Diego, Naval Base Coronado and Naval Base Point Loma will leave for the sea, the Navy said. Ships that stay will take precautions to avoid damage, it said.\nSpaceX delayed the launch of a satellite-carrying rocket from a base on California\u2019s central coast until at least Monday. The company said conditions in the Pacific could make it difficult for a ship to recover the rocket booster.\nA tropical storm watch for Southern California was changed tonight to a tropical storm warning, the National Hurricane Center said in a 11 p.m. ET (8 p.m. PT) advisory.\nThe tropical storm warning now extends from the California-Mexico border to Point Mugu, which is close to Oxnard on the Pacific Coast, and including Catalina Island, the agency said.\nHurricane Hilary is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm by the time it reaches Southern California, which the hurricane center said was forecast to occur by Sunday night.\nBut heavy rain and possible flooding are a risk for California and other parts of the U.S. Southwest.\nWhile officials in California have been urging people to take Hilary seriously, Las Vegas and other parts of the Southwest also face possible floods.\nA likely scenario in Las Vegas is up to 2 1/2 inches of rain through Monday, according to the National Weather Service, but another scenario estimates 3 inches or more.\nLas Vegas is under a flood watch from 11 a.m. tomorrow through 5 p.m. Monday, according to the weather service.\nIt and other parts of Nevada were considered to have a \u201cmoderate\u201d flood risk from the storm, according to the National Hurricane Center. Las Vegas\u2019 city government opened a sandbag location.\nNevada Gov. Joe Lombardo said today he was activating 100 National Guard members in advance of the storm making landfall.\nThe troops will support areas that are impacted by the storm, his office said.\nIn Arizona, the state Department of Public Safety also warned drivers of rain and urged caution.\nThe expected impacts from the storm in Southern California were trending a little heavier when it comes to rainfall, the National Weather Service said today.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s a waiting game watching it move northwards,\u201d Alex Tardy, senior meteorologist at the weather service in San Diego, said in a video briefing.\nThe coasts and valleys could see 2 1/2 inches of rain, but at rates of 1/4 to 3/4 of an inch per hour, according to the agency, and the Inland Empire could see 4 inches.\nSome mountains could see up to 10 inches of rain, the weather service said. Lower deserts could get up to 7 inches of rain.\nCurrently a hurricane, it is expected to weaken to a tropical storm before it reaches California. It is expected to reach Southern California by Sunday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.\nWhen Hilary reaches Southern California, it will bring estimated maximum winds of 50 mph, a National Hurricane Center official said.\nBut it\u2019s the rain, and the rate of rain that poses the most risk, National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said today.\nSome areas will see 2 to 4 inches, others 4 to 6, and some parts of Southern California even showed possibly 10 inches of rain.\n\u201cThese rainfall amounts are not typical of this area,\u201d Rhome said video briefing. \u201cNot only that, it\u2019s going to come down much faster than what this area is used to seeing.\u201d\nLos Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas were all under a \u201cmoderate\u201d risk of floods, and areas like Palm Springs, California, were considered to be at high risk, he said.\nParts of mainland Mexico were prepped for Hilary, with 18,000 soldiers on alert.\nOn Friday evening, the hurricane was centered about 310 miles south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, near the southern tip of the Baja peninsula. It was moving northwest at 12 mph and expected to turn more toward the north.\nSome Cabo San Lucas schools were being prepared as temporary shelters, said Flora Aguilar, a city official.\nIn La Paz, the picturesque capital of Baja California Sur state on the Sea of Cortez, police patrolled closed beaches to keep swimmers out of the whipped-up surf. Schools were shut down in five municipalities.\nThe incoming storm \u201cis potentially an unprecedented extreme weather event\u201d for Los Angeles and the region, but Mayor Karen Bass said that the city is prepared.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not waiting for the storm to hit,\u201d Bass said at a news conference.\nThere could be flash flooding across the Los Angeles area, according to the National Weather Service, and there could be tropical-storm force winds.\nLos Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said that over 3,500 firefighters are \u201cstanding ready\u201d and that it has search and rescue teams that have responded to hurricanes elsewhere in the country.\nLos Angeles County could get 2 to 4 inches of rain, and up to 7 inches in parts of the San Gabriel Mountains and foothills, Carol Parks, general manager of the city\u2019s Emergency Management Department, said.\nWith 48 to 60 hours until this event, our high-resolution computer models are showing the areas of greatest concern for rainfall.\nThis is the 4KM American NAM model that comes out every six hours.\nNotice the thin yellow line traveling from the Northern Baja just east of San Diego and Los Angles. This is the spine of very tall mountains known as the Peninsular Range. This is where 6 to 10 inches of rain is expected to fall in a short amount of time.\nIf there is catastrophic flooding from Hilary, it will happen near or to the east of this yellow strip.\nNotice much lighter amounts, 1 to 3 inches, closer to the densely populated coastal region. This is still enough for minor flash flooding, debris flows or landslides  \u2014 but does not carry the same level of concern we have for the high peaks and their east-facing slopes.\nBaseball teams are making adjustments to fit in their weekend games ahead of Hurricane Hilary.\nSeveral games that had been scheduled for Sunday have been moved up a day, and will become the earlier games of Saturday split doubleheaders.\nHurricane Hilary\u2019s outer bands are starting to enter southern parts of Baja California in Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said.\nIn a 5 p.m. PT update, the center said that Hilary, a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, is likely to cause life-threatening flooding.\nThe hurricane\u2019s center is expected to move close to the west coast of Baja California over the weekend, according to the Hurricane Center.\nBut the storm\u2019s effects stretch far from the center. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles, and tropical storm-force winds extend up to 275 miles, the weather agency said.\nSeveral cities in southeastern California that are in the current path of of the storm, including Coachella City, are  below sea level. The parts of the region are currently forecasted to receive up to five inches of rain during the next five days.\nOfficials in San Diego today warned residents to be prepared to shelter in place and take other measures.\n\u201cThis is real,\u201d Chris Heiser, executive director for the Office of Emergency Services, said at a news conference.\n\u201cThis is not like the other storms we\u2019ve experienced. It\u2019s a huge footprint, it goes all the way from the desert out into the ocean,\u201d he said.\nHurricane Hilary is a Category 4 storm but is expected to weaken and become a tropical storm before reaching California, according to the National Hurricane Center.\nThere could be 12 inches of rain in the mountains in a short period of time, Heiser said.\n\u201cOur city is downstream. It\u2019s not if you are going to see flooding,\u201d he said, adding people should anticipate possible power outages.\nThe National Weather Service today expanded a tropical storm watch to include all of Los Angeles County, as well as other areas.\nTropical storm watches had previously been issued for some parts of the region, but the new one includes the entire county, which has a population of around 10 million people.\nA watch means that tropical storm conditions, which include sustained winds of 39 mph to 73 mph, are possible.\nUsing helicopters, bullhorns and people on the ground, officials in Los Angeles County will be reaching out to the homeless in riverbeds and elsewhere to warn about the impending storm, authorities said today.\nLast night, aircraft with the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department looked for encampments and will continue to do so today, Sheriff Robert Luna said at a news conference. Rescue aircraft and swift-water rescue teams will also be on alert, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move them to safer locations,\u201d Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Janice Hahn said.\nThe Los Angeles River is channelized and swells with water during heavy rains.\nThe most recent count found an estimated 75,520 people in Los Angeles County experience homelessness on any given night. Of those, around 55,155 were unsheltered.\nLos Angeles County officials urged people to exercise caution over the weekend and, if possible, stay off roads Sunday and Monday, when rainfall from the storm is expected to reach its peak.\nIn a news conference this afternoon, representatives from the Office of Emergency Management and the Sheriff\u2019s Department shared preparations as Hurricane Hilary approaches.\nSheriff Robert Luna said Hilary is expected to bring \u201csignificant rain, possible flash flooding, severe winds, storm surge, dangerous surf, marine conditions, and even possibly tornadoes.\u201d He urged residents to make preparations, have an emergency plan and check in on friends and family in high-risk areas.\nEmergency preparedness resources can be found at https://ready.lacounty.gov. Officials also urged residents to sign up for emergency alerts via text, phone or email at https://ready.lacounty.gov/alerts/.\nKevin McGowan, director of the Office of Emergency Management, outlined steps that residents can take to stay safe:\nThe Mexican government said a weakened Hilary might skim a sparsely populated area on the western edge of the Baja peninsula early Sunday, and then perhaps hit between the Pacific coast cities of Ensenada, and Playas de Rosarito, a beach community on the edge of Tijuana.\nTijuana Mayor Montserrat Caballero Ramirez said the city was tracking the storm closely, clearing out storm drains.\nThe sprawling border metropolis of 1.9 million is particularly at risk of landslides and flooding, in part because of its hilly terrain. Shacks are perched on cliffs with little vegetation to hold the land in place. In addition, scores of people have been living under tarps on the streets and in canals in flood zones, including migrants who arrive daily from various parts of the world.\nThe city was in the process Friday of opening four shelters in high-risk zones and was prepared to increase that if needed, once the storm hits, Caballero Ramirez said. City workers also cleared 34 storm drains of trash and debris, and were going to neighborhoods to warn residents.\n\u201cWe are a vulnerable city being on one of the most visited borders in the world and because of our landscape,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the magnitude yet of what can happen but that\u2019s why we are coordinating with the military and others so we can move immediately with our emergency response protocols if needed.\u201d\nMexico extended its hurricane watches and warnings northward for parts of Baja California peninsula, and also issued a tropical storm watch for parts of mainland Mexico. Some 18,000 soldiers were put on alert.\nThe final weekend of Splash House 2023 will take place as scheduled in Palm Springs, \"rain or shine,\" according to the organizers.\nThey said they're monitoring the storm moving into the area and are looking forward to welcoming guests for the event, which runs Aug. 18-20.\n\"We know a little moisture doesn't deter you \u2014 we've seen you getting down in the pools year after year \u2014 and we salute your spirit,\" the organizers wrote on Instagram. \"It's that energy that keeps us going and what already has us thinking through back up plans to give you the party you deserve, just in case.\"\nMore than a year\u2019s worth of rain could drench parts of Southern California and the Southwest this weekend, as Hurricane Hilary churns in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\nHeavy rainfall across the southwestern United States is expected to peak on Sunday and Monday, but could persist through the middle of next week, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\u201cRare and dangerous flooding will be possible,\u201d the center said Friday in a public advisory, adding that other parts of the West could see rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches.\nHurricane Hilary, currently a Category 4 storm, is expected to weaken over the weekend as it passes over cooler ocean waters off the California coast, but it could make a rare landfall in Southern California as a tropical storm \u2014 the first in the region since 1939. But no matter where Hilary hits land, experts say people across the Baja California peninsula, the Southwestern U.S. and parts of Mexico should prepare for major rainfall and flooding.\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday that the White House is \"closely monitoring\" Hurricane Hilary, noting that FEMA has pre-positioned personnel and supplies in the area.\n\"I urge everyone, everyone in the path of the storm, to take precautions and listen to the guidance from state and local officials,\" he said.\nThe remarks came at the beginning of a joint press conference at a Camp David summit with the leaders of Japan and South Korea.\nResidents in Azusa, a city in the San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County, were grabbing sandbags on Friday in preparation for the storm this weekend.\n\"Rain is coming, you know,\" Jose Pasco told NBC Los Angeles. \"We want to put something along our patio so the water won't go inside the house.\"\n\"I hope it's not that hard,\" Pasco said about the incoming storm.\nA resident named Ron said he's never heard of a storm of this caliber hitting the area.\n\"I've lived here all my life and I've never seen it,\" Ron said.\nNews of Hurricane Hilary barreling toward Southern California has drawn reminders of \"El Cordonazo,\" a tropical storm that hit the state nearly 84 years ago.\n\"El Cordonazo,\" which made landfall in Long Beach in September 1939, is the last tropical storm recorded in California.\nAlso known as \u201cThe Lash of St. Francis,\u201d the storm \"lost hurricane status shortly before moving onshore at San Pedro\" and caused the greatest September rainfall ever in the area, the National Weather Service said in a document recounting the history of significant weather events in SoCal.\nRainfall in Los Angeles was recorded at 5.4 inches in 24 hours, per the agency's data. Eastern Coachella Valley was under 2 feet of water.\nA total of 45 people died in the floods and 48 more died at sea.\n\"Californians were generally unprepared and were alerted to their vulnerability to tropical storms,\" the agency said. \"In response, the weather bureau established a forecast office for southern California, which began operations in February of 1940.\"\nAs it moves toward Southern California, Hurricane Hilary could bring impressive surf to beaches along the coast.\nAccording to the Surfer Forecast, a website that tracks surf conditions, on Sunday morning surfers will be able to catch waves up to 8 feet at Long Beach and, as the day progresses, 6-foot waves will swell from Malibu beaches up to Ventura.\nSurfer Magazine writes that these waves could make for \u201cgreat surfing if you can handle the size,\u201d but advises surfers to stay cautious. Popular surfing forecaster WaveCast warned those attempting the surf zone to be on the lookout for rip currents, lightning, rain and wind effects.\nHurricanes create waves that can be ideal for surfers looking to ride the best waves. Last year, East Coast surfers braved rough waters from Hurricane Ian to get to sizable waves in places like the Outer Banks and even in Florida, just days before the storm made landfall.\nThough surfing during a hurricane can be fun, it can also be deadly. In 2011, two surfers were killed in rough waves in north Florida during Hurricane Irene.\nAs airlines continue to monitor Hurricane Hilary, some are offering flexible travel options to those whose flights may be impacted by the storm.\nUnited Airlines is allowing customers flying in and out of San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo International Airport (SJD), at the southern tip of Baja, to reschedule their trips at no cost.\nSouthwest Airlines is offering the same option so long as the new flight is booked within 14 days of the original date of travel.\nAlaska Airlines is offering similar options and is including those flying in and out of Loreto International Airport, in Mexico, as well as SJD through Aug. 25, according to their website.\nA giant heat dome over the middle of the country is partly to blame for Hilary\u2019s unusual path toward Southern California, according to hurricane experts.\nThe heat dome, created by a high-pressure system trapped in place, is expected to bring stiflingly hot temperatures to large portions of the central and southeastern United States through the weekend. But this high-pressure system and its associated winds are also influencing Hurricane Hilary\u2019s movements, essentially pulling the storm toward California.\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving further east than it would normally go as it travels north,\u201d said Hugh Willoughby, a research professor in the Department of Earth & Environment at Florida International University.\nTropical cyclones that develop in the eastern Pacific Ocean can wander north off the coast of California, but they typically get pushed west, he added. This time, however, Hilary is turning northwest and barreling up the coast.\n\u201cNormally they would go by and out to sea,\u201d Willoughby said, \u201cbut this is further east than the normal north-going path, which is why we\u2019re seeing it in California.\u201d\nForecasters at the National Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to approach the central Baja California peninsula on Saturday before moving inland over Southern California Sunday night.\nA tropical storm watch is now in effect from the California-Mexico border to the county lines between Orange and Los Angeles counties, as well as for Catalina Island, the National Hurricane Center announced this morning.\nThis is the first time the NHC has issued a tropical storm watch for this region of the country.\nThis kind of alert is typically used to warn that tropical storm conditions are possible in the designated watch area within 48 hours.\nThe topography of Southern California is going to dictate who is most at risk for destructive flash flooding.\nThe Santa Rosa mountain range east of San Diego runs north-south for 30 miles with a maximum height of over 8,698 feet at Toro Peak. Those areas could see the brunt of the rainfall thanks to orographic lift, which is when air is pushed by the wind up a mountain. When that happens, the air cools and condenses, often resulting in heavy rainfall.\nIn this case, the lift will be maximized over a large area, and rainfall rates are expected to reach 3 inches per hour at the peak of the storm Sunday night.\nThis is why the National Weather Service issued a rare Day 3 High Risk of flash flooding that includes Cleveland National Forest and a good part of the Sunrise Highway. The heaviest runoff and mud/debris flows will be on the eastern slopes of the Santa Rosa Mountains.\nIf the state record of 14 inches from a tropical system is to broken by Hilary, it will happen there.\nAs Hurricane Hilary charges toward the southern tip of Mexico\u2019s Baja California peninsula, forecasters say it\u2019s still \u201cnearly impossible\u201d to predict where the storm could collide with the coastline.\nThe hurricane's current forecasted path shows it passing along the coast of Baja, weakening as it moves north to Southern California, according to the National Hurricane Center. Hilary could become the first tropical storm to make landfall in Southern California in 84 years, since September 1939. But where exactly landfall will occur is still up in the air.\nRegardless of where the storm hits, forecasters said people across the Baja California Peninsula and the southwestern United States should be prepared for heavy rainfall, flash flooding and other significant impacts.\n\u201cHilary\u2019s exact landfall probably won\u2019t make much difference when it comes to the expected hazards and impacts in the region,\u201d NHC officials said Friday in a forecast discussion.\nDaily, monthly and state rainfall records are all in jeopardy as Hilary heads toward California.\nSome places, like Death Valley and Palm Springs, could see up to three years' worth of rain in the span of just a few days. Flash flooding is possible.\nWhile rain will be the greatest risk, high winds are also forecast. There is more uncertainty associated with which areas might experience the strongest winds, which is highly dependent on the track of the storm.\nWind gusts of 30-50 mph will be possible across Southern California, including across Los Angeles and Ventura counties.\nHilary has rapidly intensified in just 24 hours from a 70 mph tropical storm to a powerful 145mph Category 4 hurricane.\nThat\u2019s more than double the definition for rapid intensification, which is 35mph in 24 hours.\nOn the current forecast track, Hilary is expected to begin weakening tomorrow as it encounters cooler water temperatures, and is forecast to be a tropical storm by Sunday as it approaches the U.S.\nHurricane Hilary remained a \"large and powerful\" Category 4 hurricane as of early Friday morning, the National Hurricane Center said in its latest update.\nHilary was about 100 miles south of Socorro Island in Mexico and about 400 miles south of Cabo San Lucas, a resort city on the southern tip of Mexico\u2019s Baja California peninsula, the hurricane center said in its 5 a.m. PT (8 a.m. ET) advisory.\nThe hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 145 mph as it barreled toward the Southwest United States.\nJoshua Tree National Park managers will shut down park areas that are vulnerable to extreme flooding in anticipation of Hilary later today.\nThe closures are expected to go into effect this evening, park officials said.\n\"Joshua Tree National Park and surrounding communities could experience heavy rainfall and potential heavy flooding,\" a statement said. The public was advised against driving down Geology Tour Road.\nPark officials warned members of the public to \"reconsider outdoor activities for this weekend, be prepared to turn around if you experience moving water on roadways and be alert for lightning.\"\nRainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches and isolated amounts of up to 10 inches are forecast for parts of southern California and southern Nevada this weekend and into early next week, the National Weather Service said.\nThe heavy rains expected \"would lead to significant impacts,\" the weather service said in a tweet.\n\"Monsoonal moisture\" along with tropical moisture connected with Hurricane Hilary are expected to increase thunderstorm coverage across parts of the Southwest today, with the possibility of heavy rainfall and flash flooding, forecasters said.\nAs Hilary continues to move north in the eastern Pacific near Baja California, the threat of heavy rainfall and flash flooding was likely to increase on Saturday, especially for parts of Southern California, western Arizona, and southern Nevada, the National Weather Service said in an early Friday update.\nWith an increase in cloud cover, \"temperatures will return to more seasonal values today before dropping below normal across much of Southern California, western Arizona, and the Great Basin over the weekend,\" the weather service said.\nIf Hurricane Hilary makes landfall on California as a tropical storm, it will be the first one in 84 years.\nIn a summer that has already produced extreme and anomalous weather, Hurricane Hilary will add to the list. It\u2019s unusual in the first place that the first tropical system to threaten the U.S. is on the West Coast, rather than along the East Coast or the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe only time a tropical storm has made landfall in California the last 100 years was in Long Beach in 1939, according to the National Weather Service.\nA storm has never been recorded to make landfall in California as a hurricane.\nHurricane Hilary, which formed early Thursday, is heading up the eastern Pacific Ocean.\nAs of Thursday evening, the storm\u2019s path was forecast to bring it across the Baja California peninsula into the southwestern U.S. over the weekend and into Monday.\nAs the storm barrels toward the southwest, follow our live tracker here:\nHurricane Hilary strengthened into a Category 4 storm as it barreled toward California, threatening to bring strong winds and heavy rains to the Southwestern U.S.\nThe system had reached maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour as of early Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\nThe system is expected to eventually weaken, but the National Weather Service warned that the storm was expected to bring \u201csignificant impacts\u201d to the Southwestern states this weekend into early next week.",

Please click here for the latest updates.\nTropical storm Hilary slammed Southern California with a deluge of rainfall, flooding roadways and breaking records in parts of the region on Sunday as it made its historic arrival.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for much of Southern California, with flash flood warnings in place until the early hours of Monday.\nThe National Weather Service warned of record-breaking rainfall and possibly life-threatening impacts. By Sunday evening, several records for daily rainfall amounts had already been broken in the Los Angeles area, the weather service said.\nOnce a Category 4 hurricane, Hilary was downgraded to a tropical depression before reaching California. It was the first tropical storm to hit southern California since 1939.\nThe storm made landfall on Sunday on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia on the peninsula\u2019s eastern coast after a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream.\nAuthorities tonight were searching for a person believed to be in the Santa Clara River in Ventura County, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nTwo other people were rescued after they were walked out of the river by first responders, the department said on X, the platform formally known as Twitter.\nThe department was using a helicopter and searchers on the ground to find the third person.\nThe river runs east-west from the Sierra Pelona Mountains in northern Los Angeles County.\nSeveral records for daily rainfall amounts were broken for this date in the Los Angeles area, the National Weather Service said tonight.\nThe service's official weather station for L.A. at the University of Southern California measured 1.53 inches of rain, breaking the last record for this date, 0.03 in 1906, it said.\nAt Los Angeles International Airport, a reading of 1.28 inches was much more than needed to break 2002's high mark of \"a trace,\" the weather service said.\nLong Beach (1.56 inches), Hollywood Burbank (1.61 inches), Palmdale (2.95 inches), Lancaster (2.72), Sandberg (1.52), Oxnard (0.77) and Santa Barbara airports (0.06) also bested previous showings for this date, it said.\nThe high temperature of 85 at Santa Maria Airport in Santa Barbara County also beat the previous high mark on this date, 82, set in 2007, according to the weather service.\nAfter Los Angeles and San Diego public school districts, the two largest in the state, announced classes were canceled tomorrow, other districts followed suit late today.\nDistrict officials in Nye County said the decision was made, in part, because county leaders recommended residents shelter in place during the storm.\nThe National Weather Service tracks river heights across the California. As Hilary moved across the southern end of the state, rainfall from the tropical storm caused river levels to surge.\nThe National Weather Service said tonight that \"life-threatening flooding\" was taking place along the Malibu coastline and in adjacent Ventura County communities.\n\"THIS IS LIFE THREATENING FLOODING!!!!!!\" the service said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\nIts warning about dangerous flooding applies to the coast from Point Dume to Point Mugu, and it includes the communities of Camarillo, Westlake Village, Somis and Spanish Hills, the weather service said.\nThe region was under multiple tropical storm and flash flood warnings.\nSwift-water rescues were taking place in Spanish Hills, where vehicles were stuck in flooded roadways, the weather service said.\nThe Phoenix Fire Department said today that it's sending a team of 16 to help deal with fallout from Tropical Storm Hilary.\nIn a statement this evening, President Joe Biden said that his administration is monitoring Tropical Storm Hilary and that the federal government had positioned resources to help with the response. In advance of landfall, FEMA sent personnel and supplies to California, and the Coast Guard moved aircraft to be available for rapid response and searches and rescues. Government agencies will continue working with California, Nevada and Arizona to get assistance to needed areas, the statement said.\n\u201cI urge people to take this storm seriously, and listen to state and local officials,\u201d the statement said.\nSan Bernardino County, one of the inland areas forecast to be hard hit by Tropical Storm Hilary, declared a local state of emergency today.\nThe declaration will clear the way for quicker state and federal assistance, the county said in a statement.\nSheriff Shannon Dicus said Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the county's emergency operations center earlier. \"Armed with insights, he could declare a state of emergency, if needed,\" the sheriff said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\nLate yesterday, the sheriff's department said mandatory evacuations were in effect for communities in the path of Hilary's torrential rains: Oak Glen, Forest Falls, Mountain Home Village, Angelus Oaks and Northeast Yucaipa.\nSan Diego dispatched outreach workers yesterday to warn homeless residents of flooding dangers from Tropical Storm Hilary.\nA spokesperson for the San Diego mayor\u2019s office said the workers talked to around 80 people and offered transportation to area shelters. The spokesperson said around half of the homeless residents workers spoke to said they would take action to immediately secure their belongings and relocate. Others told outreach workers they weren\u2019t interested in leaving but agreed to spread the word about the flood risk and the city\u2019s offer of shelter.\nHomelessness is a critical issue across San Diego County. The number of unhoused residents in the region increased by at least 14% this year, according to the results of a 2023 study from the San Diego Regional Task Force on Homelessness. The Floodplain Management Plan for San Diego County identifies canyons and riverbeds as areas that flood quickly in severe rain events.\nPalm Springs recorded 2.06 inches of rain since midnight, a record for the date, a National Weather Service forecaster said.\nGov. Gavin Newsom mentioned the record at a news conference today about Tropical Storm Hilary's impacts in Los Angeles. The sun was shining when his team visited, he said, and shortly after it left, the city was deluged.\nThe previous record for this date in Palm Springs was 0.21, or about a fifth of an inch, in 2003, according to weather service meteorologist Elizabeth Adams.\nThe figure of 2.06 was for the day's rain through about 4:30 p.m., she said, and much more was expected. \"For the Coachella Valley, the heaviest should be in the next four or five hours or so,\" Adams said.\nThe storm had long been expected to be especially onerous for the Coachella Valley, where Palm Springs is located, as well as for other desert communities and Southern California's inland mountain ranges.\nEisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage appeared to be experiencing minor flooding today.\nNBC News national climate reporter Chase Cain posted photos on social media that show a few of the hospital's hallways filled with a shallow layer of water.\nHe said an adjacent pond had overflowed. Workers trying to clean up the water used sandbags to keep more out, Cain reported.\nRancho Mirage is a desert city in the Coachella Valley, which was forecast to get some of the worst rains of the storm.\nA spokesperson for the hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLos Angeles public schools will be closed Monday, as Tropical Storm Hillary was expected to continue to bring heavy rain and possible catastrophic flooding to Southern California.\nLos Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho delivered the news this afternoon.\n\"Tomorrow there will be no schools active across L.A. Unified,\" he said. \"Everything will be shut down.\"\nThough charter schools can make their own decisions about closing, Carvalho said it was likely they would be closed, too.\nHe asked employees who must work to work from home.\nCarvalho said it would be difficult to determine which schools maintained safe access amid flooding and possible damage, and he said it would be dangerous for children and district bus drivers to make their way to campuses in the morning.\n\"We expect full resumption of all educational services beginning Tuesday morning, as scheduled,\" he said.\nAs Hilary continued to inundate Southern California with historic rain, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin M.

        "title": "Hurricane Hilary: What Southwestern U.S. residents should know",
        "text": "Hurricane Hilary strengthened into a Category 4 storm by Friday morning as it barreled towards the U.S. Southwest.\nAll eyes are on the potential for significant impacts in California and the Southwest from the storm, which had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph as of early Friday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.\nHilary had been forecast to become a major Category 4 hurricane but it is expected to weaken, according to the center.\nIf it makes landfall on California as a tropical storm, it will be the first one in 84 years.\nOn Thursday the track had it making landfall near San Diego as a tropical storm at 6 a.m. Monday, the National Weather Service for Los Angeles said, but shifts east or west could increase impacts for LA.\nThe National Weather Service warned early Friday that Hilary was expected to bring \"significant impacts\" to the Southwestern U.S. this weekend into early next week.\nCalifornia could see several months\u2019 worth of rain in just one or two days, potentially causing flash floods.\nThree to 5 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of 10 inches, could fall in parts of Southern California and Southern Nevada, the Hurricane Center said.\n\u201cThe biggest threat in our area will definitely be the risk of flash flooding associated with heavy rain,\u201d the Weather Service for San Diego tweeted Thursday night.\nAs Hilary heads north in the Pacific Ocean, the center of the storm will approach the Baja California peninsula over the weekend and California and the Southwest by late Sunday or early Monday.\nWhile some wind impacts are likely for areas in the path, the rain will be the greatest risk.\nHeavy rain will begin to threaten Southern California and the Southwest on Friday night and last into early next week. The peak impacts are expected Sunday and Monday, when significant flash flooding may occur. During this time, forecasters expect  2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of more than 8 inches from Southern California to southern Nevada.\nThat would be a stunning amount of rain for August, the driest month of the year across the region. Los Angeles averages 0.00 inches of rain for the month and San Diego just 0.01 inches.\nAhead of the threat, the Weather Prediction Center has already placed parts of Southern California and the Southwest under a slight risk for flooding rain Saturday into Sunday and a moderate risk for heavy rain Sunday to Monday.\nFor the Baja California peninsula, 3 to 6 inches of rain (locally up to 10 inches) is forecast to fall through Sunday night.\nThe storm is forecast to weaken because of land interaction and cooler sea surface temperatures farther north, but there is still potential for it to remain a tropical storm as it approaches California.\nIn a summer that has already produced extreme and anomalous weather, Hurricane Hilary will add to the list. It\u2019s unusual that the first tropical system to threaten the U.S. is on the West Coast, rather than along the East Coast or the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe only time a tropical storm has made landfall in California the last 100 years was in Long Beach in 1939, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe National Hurricane Center was also tracking two other tropical systems in the Pacific Ocean.\nA weakening Tropical Storm Greg passed well south of Hawaii on Thursday morning. Except for some breezier trade winds, no major impacts to Hawaii were expected.\nAt 11 a.m. ET on Thursday Tropical Storm Fernanda was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone. The remnants of Fernanda are forecast to bring some deep tropical moisture to the islands, which will increase humidity and rainfall chances for all islands. Locally heavy rain will be possible, especially across Maui and the Big Island, through Tuesday night.\nKathryn Prociv is a senior meteorologist and producer for NBC News.\nChantal Da Silva is a breaking news editor for NBC News Digital based in London.",

San Diego on Sunday saw 1.82 inches of rain, its wettest day on record, and Palm Springs recorded 3.18 inches of rain Sunday, which not only made for the wettest summer day the city has ever had but was also the record for the most rain in a single day, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe system had weakened and was making it way north and east. Idaho could see potential thunderstorms and localized torrential rains Tuesday from what\u2019s left of Hilary, said Jackson Macfarlane, a meteorologist with the weather service in Boise, Idaho.\nNo storm-related deaths were reported in California, but there were dozens of rescues Monday in Cathedral City.\nIn the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Franklin churned today near Haiti and the Dominican Republic, while forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said another storm could develop and reach the Gulf of Mexico coastline tomorrow.\nThe storm system that created headaches in Southern California and areas of Nevada continues to make its way inland.\nIdaho could get thunderstorms and localized torrential rain tomorrow from what's left of Hilary, said Jackson Macfarlane, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, Idaho.\nRemnants from Tropical Storm Hilary will bring much-needed rain to parts of Oregon tonight and tomorrow, according to the National Weather Service.\nCentral Oregon and eastern Oregon, east of the Cascade Range, could get up to a half-inch of rain during scattered rainfall and thunderstorms tomorrow, said Tyler Kranz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Portland.\nThe area got up to an inch of rain from 5 p.m. yesterday to 5 p.m. today, Kranz said.\nTomorrow\u2019s predicted rain will not be enough to cause major flooding, Kranz said.\n\u201cThis is nothing more than a beneficial rain,\u201d he said. \u201cPretty much all of Oregon can certainly use some rain right now.\u201d\nA natural El Ni\u00f1o, human-caused climate change, a stubborn heat dome over the country\u2019s midsection and other factors cooked up Tropical Storm Hilary\u2019s record-breaking slosh into California and Nevada, scientists figure.\n\u201cCooked up\u201d is the key phrase, because hot water and hot air were crucial in rapidly growing Hilary and then steering the storm on an unusual path that dumped 10 months' rain in a single weekend in normally bone-dry places. Nearly a foot of rain fell along a couple of Southern California mountains, while cities smashed summertime records.\n\u201cIt was a combination of sort of a perfect situation of everything coming together in a way that made the storm possible,\u201d said University of Albany atmospheric scientist Kristen Corbosiero, an expert on Pacific hurricanes.\nMartina Zacarias, a farmworker in the Eastern Coachella Valley, called for help evacuating late Sunday when the wind turned fierce, the streets began flooding and the trees outside her mobile home bent deeply under the power of Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\u201cIt seemed like a tornado, because the air went everywhere. There\u2019s a giant tree on the corner, and it bent it, it bent it horribly,\u201d she said.\nHilary was the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years. In the hours after the storm swept through the area, calls to TODEC Legal Center, which serves farmworkers of the Coachella Valley, changed from pleas for rescue to entreaties about finding work. Now, the questions for many farmworkers center on how they will pay for rent and food \u2014 all without the day-by-day income they earn because the fields where they normally harvest, plant or till are inaccessible or may be flooded.\nThe Eastern Coachella Valley \u2014 which is made up of the unincorporated rural communities of Thermal, Oasis, Mecca and North Shore \u2014 is home to many farmworkers, a population that often lacks legal status and isn\u2019t eligible for unemployment or federal disaster aid. The area also lacks adequate infrastructure, making the population more vulnerable.\nRiverside County, where the Coachella Valley is located, declared a state of emergency this afternoon after officials assessed the damage, KTLA-TV of Los Angeles reported. The proclamation requires approval from the county Board of Supervisors, the station reported.\nFlooding from Tropical Storm Hilary moved about eight rail cars from their parking spots on tracks north of Cathedral City, railway operator Union Pacific said.\nThe dislodging happened earlier today at a rail yard or a storage area, the company said in a statement. No injuries were reported.\n\"The trains, which were empty, derailed in an upright position,\" Union Pacific said.\nThe company located the incident 4 miles north of Cathedral City, a municipality just east of Palm Springs. Area first responders did not provide additional details about the incident.\nFirefighters in Cathedral City, California, worked overnight and into this morning to rescue people.\nFire Chief Michael Contreras said his firefighters \"responded better than I could ever imagine.\"\nThe department rescued 14 patients from a care home near an emerging sinkhole. Eight people were unable to walk, and, after trial and error, rescuers used the bucket of a bulldozer to transport them to safety, Contreras said.\n\"It\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve ever done in my 34 years as a firefighter,\" he said.\nOne person at a nearby gas station experienced a medical emergency and was hospitalized, Contreras said. It wasn't clear whether weather triggered the emergency.\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District will reopen tomorrow, city officials said this afternoon in an update on the storm.\nEight emergency temporary shelters for the homeless, with about 400 shelter units, remain open, the city said.\nThe city said 10,462 customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were without power.\nThe city fielded calls about potholes and downed trees and wires.\nThe city had cleared 179 of 1,089 tree-related issues. Seven of 61 potholes had been repaired, and 15 reports of mudflows had been cleared out of 38, the city said.\nAn entire city near Los Angeles experienced a power outage Monday, authorities said.\nThe outage blanketed San Fernando, city officials announced on its website and Facebook page. Officials said they expected power to be restored about 1 p.m. PT.\nThe city did not state the cause of the outage. It was unknown whether the outage was related to Tropical Storm Hilary.\nSan Fernando is about 25 miles north of Los Angeles.\nThe city said in a statement: \u201cThe entire City of San Fernando is experiencing a power outage. Southern California Edison is working on restoring power. Updates will be provided as soon as additional information is received. Drivers are reminded to stop at all intersections that do not have working traffic signals \u2014 they should be treated like a four-way stop.\u201d\nNo one with the city could immediately be reached today for an update.\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported following flooding on Mount Charleston in Clark County, Nevada, officials said.\nThe flooding started overnight after Spring Mountains National Recreation Area got a large amount of rain, Mount Charleston Fire Chief Jorge Gonzalez said today at a news briefing.\nGonzalez said the flooding is the worst he has seen since 2008, when he became fire chief.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t describe it. I\u2019ve never seen it like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of water we got last night, it\u2019s huge.\u201d\nOfficials are working to evacuate visitors who are staying in cabins and lodges in Mount Charleston but are having a hard time accessing the different subdivisions, Gonzalez said.\nThere had been no reports that structures were affected as of this afternoon.\nGonzalez said there are about 150 to 200 residents on Mount Charleston, none of whom been made service requests, Gonzalez said.\nPower and water have been shut off in the area, and propane tanks, which some residents rely to power their homes, have also been affected, Gonzalez said. It's not clear how long residents will be without power and water.\nAround 14 Nevada National Guard personnel have been deployed to Mount Charleston for assistance.\nA video shot from a helicopter shows a flooded parking lot surrounding Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\nThe video, posted by dodgeraerial on Instagram, an account that describes itself as the \u201cofficial Dodger Stadium Aerial page,\u201d captures the aftermath of Tropical Storm Hilary\u2019s impact near the iconic stadium yesterday morning.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers responded to the attention the aerial video was garnering on social media, posting today on the platform X, formerly Twitter: \u201cDodger Stadium trending? We get it. It looks beautiful this morning.\u201d\nThe post was accompanied by two pictures of a pristine aerial view of the inside of the stadium, along with a photo of the stadium\u2019s dry parking lot.\nVideos posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, shows cars wading through the flooded streets of Coachella, a Riverside County city about 135 miles southeast of L.A.\nIn one of the videos, posted by X user @kangspace589, cars drive through an intersection as several inches of water floods the steret.\n\"Yeah, we got battle damage,\" someone says in the background of the video, as what appears to be a piece of metal floats in the middle of the road. \"It's pretty hectic.\"\nIn another video posted by the same user, a car drives through flooded, desolate streets.\n\"Just boatin' around \u2014 yup, boatin',\" someone says in the background.\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said the city managed to avoid the worst possible outcomes of the storm thanks to effective preparation.\n\"The worst that we feared never came to pass,\" he said at a news conference this afternoon.\nOfficials credited a combination of effective drainage, communication and sheltering practices.\n\"We made sure that we best positioned our personnel and our assets to avoid catastrophic loss of life and property,\" Gloria said.\nGloria said that while 118 homeless people spent the night in city shelters, the shelters had only a 72% use rate overall, noting that officials hope they can manage to shelter a greater proportion of that population.\n\u201cEven when a hurricane is amongst us, it can be difficult to get folks to accept offers of shelter,\" he said.\nSan Diego got a historic 1.82 inches of rainfall yesterday, surpassing the previous Aug. 17, 1977, record of 1.80 inches, the National Weather Service said. Officials saved 13 people who were stranded on a section of high ground near a riverbank, Gloria said.\nMore than 1,000 customers in San Diego County remained without power as of noon local time today, according to PowerOutage.us.\nA video posted to TikTok shows a car being pulled out of a flooded Los Angeles river in the Highland Park neighborhood near Interstate 110 and Avenue 43.\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna is \"cautiously optimistic\" that damage from Tropical Storm Hilary will be minimal, he said on NBC News NOW.\n\"I believe, from what I see now, and I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, as I\u2019ve said, that our team did very well,\" he said, adding that authorities are still evaluating the extent of potential damages.\n\"From our perspective, we're at the tail end of the storm,\" Luna added, noting that significant rainfall, flooding and wind occurred overnight. NBC News' Dylan Dreyer reported in her forecast on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show that the storm was weakening across Southern California and that heavy rains were scheduled to hit eastern Oregon and Idaho as the day went on.\nLuna said there were no injuries and \"very little damage\" from the 5.1-magnitude earthquake that struck north of Los Angeles yesterday.\nThe Palm Springs city manager has declared a local state of emergency as a result of Tropical Storm Hilary.\nVideo shows flash flooding in the streets. The floods contain tree branches and other debris.\nAround 18,000 utility customers were still without power in Los Angeles this morning, said Martin Adams, the Water and Power Department\u2019s general manager and chief engineer.\nAt one point, 41,000 of agency\u2019s 1.5 million utility customers didn't have power, he said at a news briefing. A little more than 22,000 customers' power had been restored, and 43 crews were working to bring power back to more customers.\nA majority of those without power live in the metro area, with the largest outage being in Beverly Grove, where just under 6,000 were in the dark as a result of an underground outage, Adams said.\nOther notable cluster outages included a little more than 2,600 customers in East Hollywood, 2,100 in Hyde Park and just under 1,500 in Hollywood. More than 45,500 utility customers were without power across California this morning, according to Poweroutage.us.\nHilary no longer meets the threshold for a tropical cyclone, meaning all tropical storm warnings issued for Southern California counties have been canceled, according to the National Weather Service.\nA tropical cyclone is \"a rotating, organized system of clouds and thunderstorms that originates over tropical or subtropical waters and has a closed low-level circulation.\" Tropical storms are cyclones with maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph, according to the agency.\nThere have been more than 100 reports of severe weather and damage resulting from the storm, including tropical storm winds, downed trees and power lines, mudslides, flash flooding and debris flows, Ariel Cohen, meteorologist in charge, said today at a news briefing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that we did not end up having significant casualties. This came from preparedness,\u201d he said.\nParts of Southern California can still expect water on roadways, mudslides and light rain showers, but the region is \"past the brunt of the impact,\" Cohen said.\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority helped more than 100 homeless people find temporary shelter yesterday as Tropical Storm Hilary took aim at Southern California.\nL.A. Metro's homeless outreach teams assisted 158 people with finding temporary shelter for the evening, Chief Customer Experience Officer Jennifer Vides said today at a news briefing.\nThere have been no reports or calls of significant injuries or damage related to Hilary in Los Angeles yet, Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said today in a briefing.\nThe fire department responded to 1,833 emergency incidents and got 4,105 calls to its 911 dispatch center, which is over 1,000 more than average, Crowley said. The city's information center also got more than 500 storm-related requests for service.\nNotable incidents include five vehicles stranded at a flooded intersection in Sun Valley last night. One person was rescued from a vehicle, but no one was injured, Crowley said.\nOvernight, 30 firefighters battled a fire at an auto wrecking yard in Wilmington that involved several semi-trucks and cars. The fire was contained, and no injuries were reported.\nThe fire department was also dispatched to 97 traffic accidents.\nDowned power lines and uprooted trees were reported in the city, said Crowley, who warned residents to steer clear of them.\nKyle Canyon Water System customers in Nevada should boil their water before they use or consume it after an emergency water system outage, according to a notice issued today.\n\"Severe, overnight flooding on Mt. Charleston \u2014 and specifically within Kyle Canyon \u2014 caused a severe leak in the Kyle Canyon Water System, resulting in major reservoir tanks losing water pressure,\" the notice says.\n\"To help protect public health, the Las Vegas Valley Water District (operator of the Kyle Canyon Water District) is advising all Kyle Canyon customers to boil tap water before using it for drinking, food preparation, brushing teeth, washing dishes and making ice until further notice.\"\nThe notice says that three minutes is long enough to boil water and that it's not necessary for showering or any other \"external uses.\"\nFloods can contaminate well water and potentially cause illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nOfficials called the move \"a precautionary measure\" and said there is not yet a timeline for when it will be lifted, adding that it will remain in effect until bacteriological results show its safety.\nKyle Canyon customers should also shut off their irrigation systems, according to the notice, which said doing so \u201cwill reduce demand on the water system.\u201d\nThe Las Vegas Valley Water District operates the Kyle Canyon Water District, which supplies water to the Clark County neighborhood.\nNo injuries or damage were reported in Los Angeles as a result of the 5.1-magnitude earthquake that shook Southern California yesterday, Mayor Karen Bass said.\n\"I want to again start by thanking our first responders,\" Bass said at a news briefing this morning.\n\"This was a coordinated collaborative approach, and reports thus far indicate that as of right now, there have not been any deaths or significant risk of injury,\" she said.\nThe city is still assessing the damage from Tropical Storm Hilary.\nVideos show flooding in San Bernardino County, an area just east of Los Angeles, which the National Weather Service said was getting the heaviest rain in the region.\nA video posted on Facebook by San Bernardino County Public Works shows streams of water rushing parallel to muddy roads in Oak Glen, a census-designated place about 26 miles southeast of the city of San Bernardino; at one point, a pickup truck barrels down one of the muddy roads and appears to briefly swerve onto the side of it.\nAnother video shows waves of muddy water rushing into the parking lot of an Oak Glen steakhouse.\nIn Phelan, a census-designated place about 40 miles northwest of San Bernardino, mud and debris flow caused the closing of a roadway depicted on video filled with rushing brown waters.\nThe 911 emergency-call service is back up in Palm Springs after an outage last night caused by the storm, Mayor Grace Garner told MSNBC's Ana Cabrera this morning.\nGarner said that it's a \"temporary fix,\" that the system is still down in other parts of the Coachella Valley and that residents of other cities may still not be able to access it.\nPalm Springs officials previously said people could text 911 or contact their police or fire stations directly in case of emergencies.\nGarner said no deaths from the storm have been reported in the city, where officials declared an emergency yesterday after heavy rain caused road closings. All but one entryway into the city remains closed, she added.\n\"Today is all about assessing the damage,\" Garner said. \"This is going to be really all-hands-on-deck.\"\nPalm Springs residents should continue to shelter in place today to keep the roads clear, Garner said earlier on NBC News NOW.\n\"Please stay home,\" she said. \"Yes, there\u2019s going to be sun today, and that\u2019s fantastic. However, we have a lot of cleanup to do, we need to assess the damage, and if the roads are clear that makes our job that much easier and we\u2019re able to get those roads open much faster if people just stay in place.\"\nHilary has weakened into a post-tropical storm as it moves over Nevada today, but in the Atlantic basin, activity appears to be ramping up.\nThree named storms have formed in the Atlantic, with the National Hurricane Center monitoring two other areas that are likely to turn into tropical depressions over the next 48 hours \u2014 one in the far east tropical Atlantic and the other in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.\nTropical Storm Emily is roaming the central Atlantic but is expected to stay out at sea. Tropical Storm Franklin is south of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Forecasts show that Franklin could strengthen into a hurricane and cross the island tomorrow evening. Tropical Storm Gert, meanwhile, is expected to be a short-lived storm that is likely to dissipate tomorrow, the center said.\nSunday was the wettest August day on record for San Diego and surrounding areas, the National Weather Service tweeted.\nSan Diego got 1.82 inches of rain, surpassing the previous Aug. 17, 1977, record of 1.80 inches, the agency tweeted.\nCuyamaca, a region of eastern San Diego County, got the most rainfall in the area, 4.11 inches, compared to 2.61 on that day in August 1977.\nPalm Springs got 3.18 inches of rain, more than an inch higher than on the previous highest day, on Aug. 1, 1930.\nSeveral areas in and around L.A. have also gotten historic rainfall, the weather service said.\nThe storm is weakening across Southern California, and the heavy rains it brought will move north throughout the day, NBC News' Dylan Dreyer reported in her forecast on the \"TODAY\" show.\nHeavy rains will hit Idaho and eastern Oregon, which could get 3 to 4 inches of rain.\nBut California is not entirely in the clear. Flash flood risks remain across southern Nevada and parts of Southern California, and 26 million people are under flood watches or flash flood warnings.\nAt 3 a.m. PT, several areas in and around Los Angeles had experienced historic rainfall, according to the National Weather Service, which tweeted that \"virtually all rainfall daily records have been broken thus far.\"\nLake Palmdale, about 60 miles north of L.A., got almost 6 inches of rain. The city of Thousand Oaks, about 45 miles west of L.A., got 3.29 inches.\nMeanwhile, the UCLA campus got 4.26 inches, and downtown L.A. got 2.38 inches, the weather service said.\nThe 911 emergency call system was down last night in Palm Springs, California, because of the storm.\nResidents can text 911 or go to the nearest police and fire stations to ask for help, officials said in a news release at 11:28 p.m.\nThe city declared a local emergency yesterday after the heavy rain led roads to be closed.\nA number of school districts and colleges in Southern California and Nevada announced closings for today in response to Hilary's arrival.\n\"We are expecting winds which may adversely impact our transportation network and system, putting students and employees at risk,\" the Los Angeles Unified School District wrote in a statement on X, previously known as Twitter, announcing the closure. Other districts, such as the San Diego Unified School District and the Nye County School District in south Nevada, announced they would close schools today.\nColleges also announced closings, including California State University, Fullerton, and Pasadena City College.\nSchools with closings are expected to resume classes tomorrow, but plans could change based on updates.\nThe deluge from the storm has swamped roads in Southern California, partly submerging vehicles in floodwaters.\nIn the photo below, a tow truck driver can be seen trying to pull a stranded car out of floodwaters on the Golden State Freeway as Hilary moved through the area yesterday in Sun Valley, a neighborhood in Los Angeles.\nTropical Storm Hilary has brought a deluge of heavy rain to California, sparking flash floods east and west of Los Angeles with its historic arrival.\nIt is the first tropical storm to hit Southern California since 1939.\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for much of the region, with flash flood warnings in place until at least 2 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET).",

        "text": "At least 73 people died when a nighttime fire ripped through a rundown five-story building in Johannesburg that was used by homeless people, emergency services said Thursday.\nSome of the people living in the building in South Africa\u2019s biggest city threw themselves out of windows to escape the blaze and might have died because of that, a local government official said. Seven of the victims were children, the youngest a 1-year-old, according to an emergency services spokesperson.\nAnother 43 people were injured in the blaze, which broke out at about 1 a.m. in the heart of Johannesburg\u2019s central business district, Johannesburg Emergency Services Management spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said.\nAbandoned and broken-down buildings in the area are common and often taken over by people desperately seeking some form of accommodation. City authorities refer to them as \u201chijacked buildings.\u201d\nMulaudzi said the death toll was likely to increase and more bodies were likely trapped inside the building. The fire took three hours to contain, he said, and firefighters had only worked their way through three of the building\u2019s five floors by mid-morning.\n\u201cOver 20 years in the service, I\u2019ve never come across something like this,\u201d Mulaudzi said.\nThe building\u2019s interior was effectively \u201can informal settlement\u201d where shacks and other structures had been thrown up and people were crammed into rooms, he said. There were \u201cobstructions\u201d everywhere that would have made it very difficult for residents to escape the deadly blaze and which hindered emergency crews trying to work through the site, according to Mulaudzi.\nSearch teams found 64 bodies, and the chance of anyone being found alive hours after the fire broke out was \u201cvery slim,\u201d he said.\nAs many as 200 people may have been living in the building, witnesses said.\nA witness who didn\u2019t give his name told television news channel eNCA that he lived in a building next door and heard people screaming for help and shouting \u201cWe\u2019re dying in here\u201d when the fire started.\nMgcini Tshwaku, a local government official, said there were indications that people lit fires inside the building to keep warm in the winter cold. Officials are looking into the cause of the blaze.\nAfter the fire was extinguished, smoke seeped out of windows of the blackened building as daylight broke. Strings of sheets and other material hung out of some of the broken windows. It was not clear if people had used those items to try and escape the fire or if they were trying to save their possessions.",

        "text": "The world responded to the earthquake Sunday, with Pope Francis praising rescuers, France saying it\u2019s ready to pitch in and Spain sending search-and-rescue crews at the behest of Moroccan officials.\n\u201cI pray for the injured, for those who have lost their lives, so many of them, and for their relatives,\u201d Pope Francis told crowds in St. Peter\u2019s Square.\nThe Royal Moroccan Armed Forces revised the quake-related death toll, now 2,122, and the number of injured, now 2,421.\nNonprofit groups have also responded to the devastation, with Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s announcing today that food trucks from his organization, World Central Kitchen, were setting up shop in hard-hit remote areas.\nGiven blocked roads and mountainous terrain, food would still often be delivered to those in need on foot, he said.\nThis liveblog has now ended. You can follow the latest updates here.\nThis afternoon, the U.S. State Department again described the number of U.S. citizens injured in the earthquake as \"small\" and said it still did not know of any Americans\u2019 deaths.\nOfficials are communicating with local authorities and are ready to provide \"appropriate consular assistance\u201d to citizens, it said in a statement.\nAlerts to keep U.S. citizens up to date are being published on the U.S. Embassy Rabat\u2019s website.\nThe U.K. government is sending 60 search-and-rescue teams to Morocco, along with equipment and medical teams, the foreign ministry announced today.\nTeams will be sent out immediately on planes provided by the Defense Ministry. Search-and-rescue teams have specialized equipment to help extract people from the rubble of collapsed buildings, including seismic listening devices and concrete cutting and breaking equipment, the foreign ministry said.\nKing Charles issued a statement of condolence on behalf of himself and his wife addressed to King Mohammed VI. He said they were deeply shocked to hear reports of the \"devastating loss of life.\"\n\"We both have countless found and special memories of our visits to your country and I cannot describe to you the depths of our sadness and sorrow at the suffering of all those affected by this appalling tragedy,\" his statement said.\nThe total number of deaths resulting has reached 2,122, and the number of injured is 2,421, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces said on X.\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the Spanish American chef, restaurateur and philanthropist, said his not-for-profit organization, World Central Kitchen, is stationing food trucks in Morocco to deliver meals to people in hard-hit areas.\nA 3.9-magnitude aftershock rattled Moroccans today as they prayed for victims of the country\u2019s strongest earthquake in more than a century and worked to rescue survivors while soldiers and workers took water and supplies to mountain villages in ruins.\nThe same areas were shaken again by a 3.9-magnitude quake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the temblor caused more damage or casualties, but it was most likely strong enough to rattle nerves in areas where damage has left buildings unstable and people have spoken of their fears of aftershocks.\nPope Francis has offered his prayers and expressed solidarity with those affected by the earthquake in Morocco.\n\u201cI would like to express my closeness to the dear people of Morocco, hit by a devastating earthquake. I pray for the injured, for those who have lost their lives, so many of them, and for their relatives,\" he told crowds in St. Peter\u2019s Square today.\n\"I thank the rescuers and all those who are working to alleviate the suffering of the people. May everyone\u2019s complete support sustain the population at this tragic time. We stand with the people of Morocco,\" he added.\nMOULAY BRAHIM, Morocco \u2014 The roads to get to this remote village are narrow, winding and treacherous \u2014 in some places blocked by boulders and rubble.\nThroughout this village you can see homes that are either destroyed or partially collapsed. This village was home to 3,000 people, but residents here tell us 40 were killed Friday night, part of the huge national toll.\nThe rescue effort is extremely complicated, with the devastation spread throughout remote villages like Moulay Ibrahim rather than concentrated in one area. Yet residents are leading the effort, digging by hand in a desperate search for survivors.\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Spain said this morning it was immediately sending search-and-rescue teams to help find survivors after a formal request from its maritime neighbor.\n\"I can confirm that Morocco has officially requested rescue and rescue aid from Spain,\" Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares said in a statement from India's capital, where he was attending the G20 summit. He said he had received a call from his counterpart in Rabat requesting the aid earlier in the morning.\n\"Once again, I would like to convey all the condolences and solidarity of the Spanish Government and the Spanish people to Morocco and the Moroccan people, and especially to the almost one million Moroccans who live with us on a daily basis in so many parts of Spain,\" Albares said.\nRescue workers are scouring the rubble in Marrakech and nearby mountain villages for remaining survivors.\nWith many of the injured in critical condition and the most affected areas remote and hard to get to, the death toll may continue to rise.\nThe official account for Morocco\u2019s men's national soccer team has posted video of players donating blood after the earthquake.\nThe team, known as the Atlas Lions, became national icons with a deep run in last year's World Cup.\nIt had been scheduled to play Liberia yesterday in a qualifier for the Africa Cup of Nations tournament, but the game was canceled in the wake of the earthquake.\nFrance says it is in touch with Moroccan authorities and is ready to deploy resources such as search-and-rescue teams on short notice.\nFrench foreign ministry spokesperson Anne-Claire Legendre said this morning that Morocco has not yet requested international assistance, adding that authorities will first evaluate the situation before they request the help they need.\nNo French citizens have been repatriated from Morocco after the earthquake, Legendre told franceinfo radio.\nAuthor TaNesha Barnes said last night\u2019s earthquake was like nothing else she had ever felt. The walls of the American\u2019s Marrakech-area apartment complex came alive and shook throughout what she described as an achingly long temblor.\nAfterward, neighbors, all physically unharmed, gathered outside and pretty much stayed there amid frightening aftershocks. Barnes said the community she now calls home has been a rock for those who need help recovering from the temblor. \u201cPeople are stocking up to help other people,\u201d she said in a Zoom interview last night.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of love, prayer and sharing,\u201d said Barnes, the CEO of Mwasi Creative Community, which aims to help Black Americans heal from traumatic and often racist and discriminatory experiences through retreats in Morocco.\nMarrakech was lit by entire neighborhoods moving outdoors in the wake of Friday\u2019s quake. The response has only strengthened her resolve that it is the place for her healing community.\n\u201cWe stayed outside,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAll of our Moroccan friends called as if we were family to make sure we were OK.\u201d\nMARRAKECH, Morocco \u2014 While the airport in Casablanca felt like business as usual, crowded but calm with tourists and traveling families, the impact of the earthquake became apparent as soon as we reached the outskirts of Marrakech.\nAt Rond Point de la Palmeraie, the main traffic circle at the entrance to the city, hundreds of people were sleeping on the sidewalks and grass along the road. The rows of people sleeping stretched the length of the boulevard driving into the city. Some people appeared to be sleeping on just mats with blankets over them, while others had more substantial supplies. Some makeshift kiosks were selling food and drinks in parking areas along the way.\nJust a few minutes down the road, though, a line of people was waiting to get into a nightclub, and across the street, the patio of the McDonald\u2019s was packed.\nWe haven\u2019t seen any signs of damage yet, but we\u2019re not in an area with the older, more affected buildings.\nThe number of deaths connected to last night's 6.8-magnitude earthquake remained officially at 2,012 early today, with 2,059 people believed to be injured, 1,404 of them critically, according to the Royal Armed Forces.\nResidents of Marrakech, one of the kingdom's six major cities, slept outdoors overnight, fearful of another major quake and discomforted by aftershocks. Other townspeople wandered aimlessly through streets littered with debris. Some buildings were destroyed or severely damaged, while others survived and stood proud amid the rubble.\nSearchers continued to find victims in the High Atlas Mountains. The epicenter of the temblor was near the range's ski resort town of Ouka\u00efmeden, about 50 miles south of Marrakech, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",

        "title": "Morocco earthquake updates: Rescuers dig for survivors with their hands",
        "text": "The earthquake that devastated much of Morocco has killed almost 3,000 people and destroyed thousands of homes, leaving many sleeping on the streets for a fourth night.\nA huge rescue operation was underway, with teams from Spain, Britain and Qatar assisting the Moroccan military \u2014 but hope is fading of finding survivors.\nMost of the dead were in the mountainous Al Haouz region in the High Atlas Mountains, near the earthquake's epicenter. Many of those killed were \"buried\" by falling debris, the government said.\nThis liveblog has now ended. Follow the latest updates here.\nThe powerful earthquake that struck Morocco late Friday, killing and injuring thousands, caused widespread damage in the popular tourist city of Marrakech and surrounding villages.\nThe United Nations estimates 300,000 people in the region were affected, with many sleeping outside amid concerns over aftershocks. Now, international aid groups are raising money to help those in need as the desperate search continues for survivors of Morocco\u2019s deadliest earthquake in more than six decades.\nThe first episode of the British television show \"Race Across the World\" has been postponed after the earthquake, the BBC said.\n\"We of course started off our journey in Marrakesh \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful city and we were so warmly welcomed by everyone during filming,\" it said a statement on X, formerly Twitter. \"Our hearts go out to the people of the country, and our thoughts are with them.\"\nIt wasn't clear whether or when the show will air.\n\"Race Across the World\" is a competition show that airs on the BBC. This year's show was meant to feature celebrities and their family members as they traveled from Marrakech to Troms\u00f8, Norway, a journey that spanned 24 countries and more than 10,000 kilometers, according to the BBC.\nService d\u2019Aide Medicale Urgente, or SAMU, first response teams are in Morocco today looking through rubble to find any survivors.\nInternational operations director Borja Gonz\u00e1lez told NBC's \"TODAY\" show that he was in the middle of the epicenter of the earthquake assisting in the search-and-rescue effort.\n\"We are looking for people still with the rescue dogs,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said. \"It's hard, because the construction, you can see, is very basic. It's full of mud and earth, and it's not easy to find a pocket of space for the survivors to be in.\"\nThere has been little equipment to assist the SAMU members, he noted. \"Neighbors, volunteers and ourselves are moving all the earth and the rocks and everything to try to look for the people,\" he said. \"There's no machinery here. It's very remote in the mountains. It's not easy for machines to arrive here.\"\nAsked whether he's hopeful survivors will be found in the rubble days after the earthquake, Gonz\u00e1lez said, \"There's always hope.\"\nThe death toll has risen to more than 2,680, with more than 2,500 people injured, officials said.\nThe Moroccan Interior Ministry said today that at least 2,681 people were confirmed dead, while at least 2,501 people were injured.\nIt said rescue efforts were still underway as responders continue to care for the injured.\nFirefighters from the United Kingdom have arrived in Morocco to assist with the rescue effort.\nFirefighters from services across the country, including the London Fire Brigade and the West Midlands Fire Service, volunteered with the U.K. International Search and Rescue Team to travel to Morocco and offer support.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve established a base in Amizmiz,\" David O'Neill, the search-and-rescue coordinator, said in a statement shared by the London Fire Brigade. \"They\u2019re undertaking needs assessments in remote villages \u2014 they\u2019ll be prioritizing those in need of rescue, medical aid, water, food & shelter.\u201d\nTeams from Doctors Without Borders, also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, are in Morocco to help assess the needs of those affected and support local authorities.\n\u201cWe expect most of the uncovered needs to be in the mountainous areas in the High Atlas,\u201d the group said on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThese areas are also the most difficult to reach as roads have also been affected by the earthquake.\u201d\nDoctors Without Borders personnel arrived in the country Saturday and have been in the assessment phase, the group said in a separate statement.\n\"We are extremely saddened by the tragic news of the earthquake that hit Morocco and the high number of victims already reported,\" it said.\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone with Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita yesterday.\nBlinken \u201cexpressed his deep sadness and extended his condolences\u201d to Bourita, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\n\u201cThe Secretary and Foreign Minister Bourita discussed how the United States can best support the Government of Morocco\u2019s leadership of the humanitarian response to this tragedy,\u201d Miller said in a statement. \u201cThe Secretary and Foreign Minister pledged to stay in close contact as response efforts continue.\u201d\nThe devastation of this earthquake \u2014 as with so many disasters \u2014 is not distributed evenly, and it\u2019s often the poorest who are hit the hardest.\nIn the village of Moulay Brahim, about 30 miles east of the epicenter, many homes are unscathed, but it appears to be the least affluent areas where houses have collapsed completely.\nAnother factor appears to be the age of the buildings, with older buildings collapsing more than modern ones.\nIn the village market, the roof of a 150-year-old mosque had fallen in. A crumbling tower now marks all that\u2019s left of what was once a shrine to a revered local sheikh.\nCivil defense responders carried away an injured survivor of the earthquake in the village of Moulay Brahim in the High Atlas Mountains of central Morocco today.\nA man who lost his family in the earthquake said Morocco's authorities were not coming to his aid.\n\"My children. My children. They are all gone. Country authorities are not coming. What do they think, that we are not from Morocco?\" he said on the French-language news channel Le7tv.\nNBC News spoke to the man, named Lahcen Ait Abdallah, outside his ruined home yesterday. He lost his wife, three daughters and 3-year-old son in the disaster.\n\"I want to just know if my children and my wife are still alive, if someone can search, look inside if my wife and my children are still alive,\" he said before he discovered his loved ones had died.\nA mosque and a marketplace have been left in ruins in the mountainous settlement of Moulay Brahim.\nThe number of people killed in the earthquake has reached almost 2,500, Morocco's military said.\nThe Royal Moroccan Armed Forces said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, that 2,497 people had died as of 10 a.m. (5 a.m. ET) today, with 2,476 injured.\nA government statement said 1,452 of those killed were in the mountainous province of Al Haouz, the earthquake's epicenter.\nMOULAY BRAHIM, Morocco \u2014 The desperate search for survivors is in a critical phase, bringing moments of breathless joy as some are pulled to safety but others of heartache when the rescuers arrive too late.\nIn the remote town of Moulay Brahim, usually an hour\u2019s drive from Marrakech, locals say 40 people were killed, 1% of the entire community. One man lost his wife, three daughters and his son, who was 3.\n\u201cI\u2019m all alone now. I had a home and a family. Now I have nothing,\u201d Lahcen Ait Abdallah, 44, said through tears of despair. \u201cWe were always together, but now I feel like I am homeless.\u201d\nThe United Kingdom sent an experienced team of 60 rescuers, complete with specialist gear and four dogs, to assist the Moroccan military in the desperate search for survivors today.\nSimon Martin, the British ambassador to Morocco, posted a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showing him standing in front of a Royal Air Force plane on a runway in Marrakech.\n\"It\u2019s with such terrible sadness that I\u2019ve witnessed the devastation of this region has suffered as a result of this earthquake. My condolences go out to everyone who lost someone in this disaster and indeed to all the Moroccan people,\" he said.\nMorocco has also accepted aid from Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\nThere is hope that loved ones didn\u2019t die when the quake hit the Atlas Mountains here in Morocco, but the smell of dead bodies is at times overpowering, and the grim faces of rescue workers speak volumes.\nDozens, sometimes hundreds, of people gather at a newly formed road created when the street below disintegrated.\nBeneath them, groups of rescue workers operating in teams of six to 12 dig their way through the rubble.\nThere is little chatter; the sounds of drills and pickaxes fill the air. The occasional sound of somebody wailing punctuates the near silence, a sad indicator that another body has been found.\nThis is a desperate race to save lives, but as each hour passes here, hope fades.\nRescue workers say finding survivors is difficult, not only because of the heat, but also because of the time that has passed since the earthquake struck \u2014 and the severity of the impact.\nStuart Ramsay is the chief correspondent for Sky News. Read the full story here.\nA huge army transport helicopter was loaded with aid bound for mountainous villages that have been cut off by the earthquake, according to pictures the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces released today on the social network X.\nThe army said it was taking \"emergency humanitarian aid\" to people living near the epicenter, in the High Atlas Mountains, which have been cut off because of repeated landslides.\nMOULAY BRAHIM, Morocco \u2014 The roads to get to this remote village are narrow, winding and treacherous \u2014 in some places blocked by boulders and rubble.\nThroughout this village, you can see homes that are either destroyed or partly collapsed. This village was home to 3,000 people, but residents tell us 40 were killed Friday night, part of the huge national toll.\nThe rescue effort is extremely complicated, with the devastation spread throughout remote villages like Moulay Ibrahim rather than concentrated in one area. Yet residents are leading the effort, digging by hand in a desperate search for survivors.\nAn image Maxar Technologies released yesterday shows collapsed building in the town of Amizmiz in the High Atlas Mountains of central Morocco.",

The walls of the American\u2019s Marrakech area apartment complex came alive and shook throughout what she described as an achingly long-term temblor.\nAfterward neighbors, all physically unharmed, gathered outside, and pretty much stayed there amid frightening aftershocks. The Moroccan people and others with roots in the region couldn\u2019t do much about the destructive wave that pulsed across the geography of North Africa.\nBut Barnes said the community she now calls home has been a rock for those who need help recovering from the temblor. \u201cPeople are stocking up to help other people,\u201d she said in a Zoom interview today.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of love, prayer and sharing,\u201d said Barnes, the CEO of Mwasi Creative Community, which aims to help Black Americans heal from traumatic and often racist and discriminatory experiences through retreats in Morocco.\nThe city of Marrakech was alighted by entire neighborhoods moving outdoors in the wake of Friday\u2019s quake.

Restoring health services and providing essential supplies also can be a priority at this stage.

        "text": "A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Morocco late Friday night, killing at least 2,000 people and injuring 2,000 in three provinces, damaging buildings and historic sites and blocking roads.\nMorocco's Interior Ministry said Saturday morning that many had been killed in the provinces of Al Haouz, Marrakech and Ouarzazate.\nIn an earlier update, the ministry said most damage occurred outside cities and towns.\nThe number of people killed rose to 2,012, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces said in a late night update Saturday, local time.\nThere are also 2,059 injured, including 1,404 in critical condition, it said.\nThe powerful earthquake damaged buildings in major cities and sent panicked people pouring into streets and alleyways from the capital Rabat to Marrakech, the county\u2019s most visited tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nVideos posted online show buildings reduced to rubble and dust, and parts of the famous red walls that surround the old city in Marrakech damaged. Tourists and others posted videos of people screaming and evacuating restaurants in the city as throbbing club music played.\nMorocco declared three days of mourning today following the 6.8 magnitude earthquake that killed over 1,000 people, according to a statement from the Royal Palace in Rabat.\nAll national flags on public buildings will also be flown at half mast across the country.\nIn a meeting shortly after the earthquake, government officials briefed King Mohammed VI on the extent of the damage left behind.\nThe King directed the distribution of clean water, food, tents and blankets among those affected, as well as the bolstering of search and rescue teams in impacted areas. He also ordered that public services resume as soon as possible.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Morocco said it's unaware of any U.S. citizens affected but said it has told Americans in the country to use caution for 24 hours following the temblor in case strong aftershocks strike the region.\n\"We are aware of reports that a 6.8-magnitude earthquake has struck Morocco outside of Marrakech and are deeply saddened by the loss of life,\" the embassy said in a statement. \"We extend our condolences to those affected by the earthquake.\"\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 when it hit at 11:11 p.m., with shaking that lasted several seconds. Morocco\u2019s National Seismic Monitoring and Alert Network measured it at 7 on the Richter scale. The U.S. agency reported a 4.0-magnitude aftershock hit 19 minutes later.\nVariations in early measurements are common, although either reading would be Morocco\u2019s strongest in years. Though earthquakes are relatively rare in North Africa, a 5.8-magnitude tremor struck near Agadir and caused thousands of deaths in 1960.\n\u201cEarthquakes are not common in the area, but [this was] not unexpected,\u201d said U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Anna Andreyev, who said the quake was the largest since 1900.\nShe added, \u201cBased on the depth and the magnitude, we can expect significant damage.\u201d\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter was in the Moroccan High Atlas Mountain range, about 46 miles southeast of Marrakech. It was also near Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa, and Oukaimeden, a popular Moroccan ski resort.\nThe head of a town near the earthquake\u2019s epicenter told Moroccan news site 2M that several homes in nearby towns had partly or totally collapsed, and electricity and roads were cut off in some places.\nAbderrahim Ait Daoud, head of the town of Talat N\u2019Yaaqoub, said authorities were working to clear roads in Al Haouz Province to allow passage for ambulances and aid to affected populations, but said large distances between mountain villages mean it will take time to learn the extent of the damage.\nLocal media reported that roads leading to the mountain region around the epicenter were jammed with vehicles and blocked with collapsed rocks, slowing rescue efforts.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter was 11 miles below Earth\u2019s surface, while Morocco\u2019s seismic agency put it at 5 miles down. The temblor involved movement of the Africa plate about 341 miles south of its convergence with the Eurasian plate, the survey said.",

The historic old city of Marrakech also suffered extensive damage.\nThe Interior Ministry said 2,012 people had been killed and 2,059 injured, including 1,404 in critical condition. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 6.8 with an epicentre some 72 km (45 miles) southwest of Marrakech.\nIn the village of Amizmiz near the epicentre, rescue workers picked through rubble with their bare hands. Fallen masonry blocked narrow streets. Outside a hospital, around 10 bodies lay covered in blankets as grieving relatives stood nearby.\n\"When I felt the earth shaking beneath my feet and the house leaning, I rushed to get my kids out. But my neighbours couldn't,\" said Mohamed Azaw. \"Unfortunately no one was found alive in that family.

        "title": "The Libya floods, mapped: How heavy rainfall destroyed Derna",
        "text": "Record rain turned into a disaster when two dams burst, sending flood water through the center of the city of Derna.\nThousands of people were killed last week when devastating floods caused by Storm Daniel\u2019s heavy rainfall hit Libya, a failed state that is still recovering from years of civil war.\nRecord rainfall was recorded in the hours leading up to the floods on Sept. 10, with winds reaching 80 mph in some parts of the country. For many, this was just another downpour, but for the 90,000 residents of the Mediterranean port city of Derna, it became a catastrophe they had to fend off by themselves. Two poorly maintained dams in the outskirts of the city failed, sending millions of cubic meters of floodwater all through downtown and washing entire neighborhoods into the sea.\nWhile the disaster has been widely blamed on climate change-induced violent weather, survivors and experts point at the complicity of local authorities in what they say was a fatal failure of public infrastructure during decades of corruption and neglect.\nIn the days leading up to the disaster, authorities began shutting down some roads. The storm kicked off in the country\u2019s northwest on Sept. 9, getting stronger by the hour and slowly moving eastward. Libya\u2019s national meteorological agency issued warnings days in advance, and Derna\u2019s now-ousted mayor called for evacuations.\nThe storm brought torrential rains that broke records, surpassing 16 inches in some areas, and water began to accumulate behind two dams near Derna.\nThe 243-foot Abu Mansour dam, some 8.6 miles from the city, was capable of holding up to 22.5 million cubic meters of water. This was more than 10 times the capacity of the lower dam, which was much closer to the Derna.\nThe two dams had suffered major damage in the 1980s, Libya\u2019s general prosecutor al-Sediq al-Sour said last week during a news conference, adding that a government study a decade later revealed cracks and fissures in their structures. Subsequent restoration efforts failed to launch despite a growing number of reports about the lack of upkeep and continued calls for maintenance.\nAl-Sour said officials would investigate the collapse of the two dams as well as the allocation and management of maintenance funds.\nBefore the flooding disaster, residents were confident the dams would hold, as they always had. Some officials were also confident, with the interior ministry\u2019s security committee ordering a curfew to be lifted on Sept. 11 \u2014 a directive that contradicted earlier evacuation orders.\nBut in the early hours of Sept. 11, the upper dam collapsed and sent a wave of water into the city, overturning cars and burying entire streets in mud.\nThinking the worst was over, residents emerged to clean up the roads.\nBut around 3 a.m. it became clear the lower dam had burst too, sending another wave that dwarfed many buildings and swallowed up people, cars, homes and bridges.\n\u201cYou could see people on buildings with their phones lit up, shouting for help, but no one could do anything. And then suddenly one of the buildings would collapse and be washed away to the sea,\u201d Yousef al-Shaari, an education department officer, said.\n\u201cIt was apocalyptic. Apocalyptic. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen a catastrophe like this, even on TV. Half a city, gone,\u201d said al-Shaari, who found himself \u201cwalking on bodies, stepping on dead people\u201d the next morning, as he joined the desperate efforts to pull out survivors.\nJiachuan Wu is a senior interactive journalist for NBC News Digital.\nMithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.",

        "title": "Why were the Libya floods so deadly?",
        "text": "A race to the roof was all that saved them from the deluge.\nIt was like being \u201cin the middle of the sea with massive waves crashing around,\u201d said high school teacher Ahmad al-Sharif, who scrambled to the top of his building with some neighbors as a wall of water swallowed up cars, homes and bodies.\nIn the darkness and faced with a wave of water so large it felt like a \u201ctsunami appearing in front of you,\u201d he recalled, neighbors were screaming as the deluge destroyed the city. Some were shouting \u201cSave us! \u201cHelp us!\u201d while others were saying the Shahada, the Islamic affirmation of faith, as the waves crashed over them and pulled them under.\nAl-Sharif, 34, spoke by voice message from a shelter in Derna, the city in eastern Libya that was devastated by last week\u2019s floods.\n\u201cMost of my friends from the neighborhood\u201d have died, he said. \u201cPeople have been found in their homes. \u2026 People have been found in the sea.\u201d\nThousands of people have been killed, with thousands more missing in the floods, which survivors and experts said was not merely a natural disaster.\nYears of civil war, corruption and institutional neglect left residents of the North African state at the mercy of Mediterranean storm Daniel\u2019s extreme weather, as did the authorities who \u201cfrankly had nothing but contempt for their people,\u201d said Tarek Megerisi, a Libya expert and senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.\nFury that simmered for a week has erupted into protests against local officials, with the home of Derna\u2019s ousted mayor having been torched.\nHere\u2019s how the heavy rain turned so deadly in Libya.\nThe rain was getting heavier and heavier around midnight, but residents in the Wadi Derna Valley felt confident that the dams would hold \u2014 as they had before.\nThe two structures, Abu Mansour and Derna, just uphill from the Mediterranean coastal city, were meant to protect its almost 90,000 residents.\nThe people were used to occasional flooding, and on Sept. 10, even rain heavy enough to fill the first dam did not sound the alarm.\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to this. \u2026 We\u2019ve seen the same scene in 2011 without a catastrophe happening,\u201d said al-Sharif, who was streaming it all live on Facebook as the canal started overflowing.\nResidents recorded videos of the water level rising, then returned home to dry off and sleep as the night got darker and wetter.\nBut it was soon clear that this was not just another downpour.\n\u201cWe started to hear screaming in the streets. \u2018Torrent! Torrent is coming!\u2019 So everyone went out onto their balconies to look, and we saw the torrent rushing into the streets with a very big force,\u201d al-Sharif said.\nIt was about 2:30 a.m., he recalled, and cars were lying overturned on streets covered in mud. Thinking the worst was over, people headed out to clean up the roads.\nAround 3 a.m., it was clear both dams had given way, as a second wave almost as high as the buildings in the neighborhood charged toward the residents, who ran to take whatever high ground they could and grab neighboring families to escape with them.\nSome, like al-Sharif, were lucky to find their stairs taking them just out of reach of the water rushing up floor after floor behind them. After he finally reached the roof, he was shocked to see what was happening outside.\n\u201cThe entire place was all submerged in water. \u2026 You don\u2019t see anything but water\u201d he said.\n\u201cGod had mercy on us,\u201d al-Sharif said. \u201cOur building survived, but the other buildings were completely wiped out, taken away with the torrent like they were biscuits.\u201d\nResidents waited until 7 a.m. for the water to recede. Al-Sharif said he walked for two hours to find safety and aid, stalked all the way by the overwhelming tragedy. \u201cThe smell of death travels down all the roads,\u201d he said.\nWhile the water brought death to Derna in a devastating and sudden rush for many residents, the floods were preceded by a litany of unheeded warnings.\nIn a research paper published last year, hydrologist Abdelwanees Ashoor of Libya\u2019s Omar Al-Mukhtar University warned the Derna \u201carea has a high potential for flood risk,\u201d citing five floods there since 1942 and calling for immediate maintenance steps for the dams.\n\u201cIn the event of a big flood, the consequences will be disastrous for the residents of the valley and the city,\u201d he wrote in the Sebha University Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences.\nSome Libyan officials have also not refrained from criticizing authorities.\nThe dams suffered major damage in a strong storm that hit the region in 1986, and more than a decade later a study commissioned by the government revealed cracks and fissures in their structures, Libya\u2019s general prosecutor, al-Sediq al-Sour, said last week.\nBut years went by as cautionary reports piled up and restoration efforts either failed to get off the ground or were abandoned in the chaos of civil war.\nAt a news conference in the stricken city, al-Sour said prosecutors would investigate the collapse of the two dams, as well as the allocation of maintenance funds.\n\u201cI reassure citizens that whoever made mistakes or negligence, prosecutors will certainly take firm measures, file a criminal case against him and send him to trial,\u201d he said.\nSurvivors are in no doubt about what or whom to blame.\n\u201cThe main cause of the disaster was the dam located south of Derna, which had not undergone recent maintenance,\u201d said Salem Mansour, 27, who lost his sister in the disaster. Speaking from the hospital in the nearby city of Tobruk, he was convinced that more could \u2014 and should \u2014 have been done to prevent this.\n\u201cThe responsibility lies with the successive corrupt governments in Libya, which neglected the safety of citizens,\u201d he said.\nThe country plunged into a spiral of conflict and civil war after opposition fighters killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in a NATO-backed Arab Spring uprising in 2011. Divided between rival administrations and riven by corruption, the country\u2019s infrastructure and public services have been neglected.\nDerna is under the authority of the country\u2019s eastern administration, controlled by the self-styled Libyan National Army of Gen. Khalifa Hifter, while the country\u2019s west is ruled by the Government of National Unity, based in the capital, Tripoli.\n\u201cMost of the civilian infrastructure has been in a state of dilapidation since their construction. There wasn\u2019t regular careful and systematic management of the Libyan infrastructure. It\u2019s really been rotting,\u201d said Megerisi, the Libya expert.\n\u201cThe country is becoming a failed state. Nobody has looked after it,\u201d he said.\nHifter\u2019s son Saddam Hifter, considered by many as the heir apparent, refused to blame the administration, telling Sky News \u201call is OK\u201d when he was asked about the flood warnings.\nAnger among residents fueled protests against local officials this week, with the home of Derna\u2019s ousted mayor, Abdel-Moneim al-Ghaithi, being set on fire after hundreds of people gathered in the city, chanting slogans and demanding accountability.\nAuthorities have been quick to respond, imposing a communications blackout and even ordering journalists to leave the area, calling it a necessary move for rescue operations.\nOne source of that anger is a sense that warnings were missed not just for years before the flood, but also in the days before the storm.\nA day before Daniel hit Libya, al-Ghaithi said at a news conference that some areas surrounding the dam should be evacuated. But an emergency committee formed by the eastern government\u2019s interior ministry instead imposed a curfew that was supposed to have lasted through the morning of Sept. 11.\nThe confusion was a sign of the kind of chaotic governance and emergency response failure that global officials said was a crucial factor.\nPetteri Taalas, the head of the World Meteorological Organization, said at a news conference last week that \u201cmost of the human casualties\u201d could have been avoided had the local and national authorities issued the correct warnings and carried out evacuations.\n\u201cThe fragmentation of the country\u2019s disaster management and disaster response mechanisms, as well as deteriorating infrastructure, exacerbated the enormity of the challenges,\u201d he said.\nIn countries like Libya with no singular nationwide administration, where corruption is rife and public infrastructure is often an afterthought, efforts from prediction to prevention are made less reliable, analysts said.\nAnd all of it only highlights a glaring issue facing the world: The effects of climate change are making acute weather phenomena like Daniel more frequent, placing additional stress on flawed structures \u2014 and states.\n\u201cClimate change is increasing weather extremes, stresses infrastructure and makes management and preparation all the more important,\u201d said Kimberly Nicholas, a sustainability science lecturer at Lund University in Sweden.\nTimely prediction of the storm and a response like the swift opening of the dam gates might have helped prevent such a disaster, experts said. But failing to identify the threat to Derna despite all the warnings was the ultimate failing, said Nadhir al-Ansari, a professor of civil, environmental and natural resources engineering at Lule\u00e5 University of Technology in Sweden who has been studying water resources in the Middle East for the past 40 years.\n\u201cThe government should have examined the areas that could be flooded in case of failure. They shouldn\u2019t have allowed the building of houses in such areas. Nobody thought of this,\u201d he said.\nAt least one resident did, in a poem that warned of the dangers of the floods.\nMustafa al-Trabelsi had attended a meeting Sept. 6 in Derna to discuss the threat of flooding there. Days later, he wrote the poem, which has been shared widely in the wake of the disaster.\nAl-Trabelsi has not posted anything since the floods, leading to fears for his safety.\nMithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.\nPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.",

        "title": "Libya floods: Derna death toll rises as bodies wash ashore, aid trickles in",
        "text": "Floodwater swept the living away, and on Wednesday it was washing bodies back onto the shores of eastern Libya faster than the devastated city of Derna could bury them.\nLibyan officials on Wednesday put the number of deaths at 8,000 and said 10,000 people are missing.\nBroken roads, failed communications networks, the legacy of years of civil conflict and the effects of climate change have all contributed to make Libya one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, said Elie Abouaoun, country director for Libya with the International Rescue Committee.\nThe eastern Libyan port city was destroyed beyond recognition when two dams burst on the Wadi Derna River during a storm this week, causing waves 23 feet high to rush through the town and into the sea.\nA total of 5,300 people had been confirmed dead in the floods so far, the Ministry of the Interior of Libya\u2019s eastern government said. But aid groups and officials have said that some 10,000 people are missing, also feared dead either beneath the wreckage of homes or lying somewhere in the floodwaters.\nThe staggering statistics only go so far in conveying the tragedy.\nOne father watched in disbelief as rescue workers pulled the limp body of his son from under rubble in Derna.\nIt's a scene that is being repeated across this city and in towns across eastern Libya.\n\u201cBodies are lying everywhere \u2014 in the sea, in the valleys, under the buildings,\u201d Hichem Abu Chkiouat, civil aviation minister in Libya\u2019s eastern government, told Reuters.\n\u201cI am not exaggerating when I say that 25% of the city has disappeared. Many, many buildings have collapsed,\u201d he said.\nHe said that officials had counted more than 5,300 dead so far, and warned the death toll was likely to rise and could even double given the number of missing.\nThe \u201csea is constantly dumping dozens of bodies,\u201d Chkiouat added.\nYann Fridez, head of the delegation of the International Committee for The Red Cross in Libya, told France24: \u201cThe city of Derna was submerged by waves 7 meters (23 feet) high that destroyed everything in their path.\u201d\nAnd for Libya there may be more chaos to come.\nOfficials in the coastal town of Tocra, to the west of Derna and east of Benghazi, warned Wednesday that a dam there could also collapse and cause similar scenes of destruction, the state-run Libyan News Agency reported. Officials urged nearby residents to leave immediately.\nSome 30,000 people from Derna alone have been displaced after their homes were washed away or ruined, according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency.\nIt is a natural disaster without precedent in a country already reeling from more than a decade of civil war and complex factional disputes.\n\"For Libya it's definitely something of equal importance like something like 9/11 to the U.S.,\" said Abouaoun, of the International Rescue Committee.\nThere are around 6,000 people presumed dead, but several thousand still unaccounted for, he said. \"So we don\u2019t know what will be the final toll.\"\nAid was slowly coming in, he said, but Derna urgently needs manpower.\n\"Several countries have already sent field hospitals and supplies,\" Abouaoun added.\n\"What is really missing is some more support with search-and-rescue operations because the window of opportunity for finding survivors is closing. We are on the second day.\"\nHe called on international aid agencies and foreign governments to help with the immediate search-and-rescue operation, just as several countries did after the earthquake in Morocco last week.\nPresident Joe Biden is among the world leaders to have already pledged support, with many of Libya's neighbors sending teams and humanitarian supplies.\nAttention has already turned to what could or should have been done to prevent the disaster in Derna.\n\u201cSome areas received instructions to evacuate, but some people didn\u2019t respond. They took matters lightly,\" Mustafa Salem, a Derna resident, told Reuters. \"We were surprised at 9 p.m. that the storm had intensified and the winds had become strong.\"\nThen Salem heard a dam break, described by some witnesses as sounding like an explosion.\n\"People were asleep and no one was ready,\" he said.\nPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.\nKelly Cobiella is a correspondent based in London.

        "title": "Libya floods death toll hits 11,300",
        "text": "At least 11,300 are now believed to have died after torrents of water ripped through eastern Libya \u2014 a devastating toll that could largely have been avoided, global officials said Thursday.\nMarie el-Drese, secretary general of the Libyan Red Crescent, told The Associated Press by phone that a further 10,100 had been reported missing in the ruined city of Derna. Earlier, city officials said the death toll could reach 20,000.\nA precise tally of the rising number of people killed is incredibly difficult to compile given the level of destruction and the chaotic political situation in the region, with bodies still washing up on the shore and burials being held in mass graves.\nAs rescuers searched underwater and under rubble, fears grew that rotting bodies could lead to a deadly outbreak of disease.\nA deluge of rainfall from Mediterranean storm Daniel caused two dams to collapse, sending waves more than 20 feet high through the heart of Derna, a port city in the country's east.\nMore than 7,000 residents were wounded, ambulance service spokesman Osama Ali told NBC News.\nNumbers have varied depending on which official has provided them, though all put the toll well into the thousands and Derna's mayor has said that it could more than triple as search teams and survivors find more bodies in the ruins.\n\u201cThe situation is very large and surprising for the city of Derna. We were not able to confront it with our capabilities that preceded the storm and the torrent,\u201d Mayor Abdel Moneim al-Ghaithi told Sky News Arabia on Wednesday night.\nHis office said that the number of those killed could hit 20,000 \u2014 around a fifth of the city\u2019s population \u2014 based on estimates of those living in areas that were swept away.\nMost of the deaths could have been avoided if authorities had better warning systems in place, the United Nations\u2019 weather and climate agency said Thursday.\n\u201cThey could have issued the warnings and the emergency management forces would have been able to carry out the evacuation of the people, and we could have avoided most of the human casualties,\u201d Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, told reporters in Geneva according to the AFP news agency.\nThe agency said this week that it issued warnings 72 hours before the dams collapsed, including contacting the Libyan authorities and making statements to the media. This led to a state of emergency being declared in the North African country.\nOne day before the storm hit Libya, the mayor said at a news conference that some areas surrounding the dam should be evacuated. But an emergency committee formed by the eastern government\u2019s Interior Ministry ordered curfews instead.\nA spokesperson for the mayor also said out the city\u2019s dam had not been maintained since 2008 because of Libya\u2019s fractious politics.\nMohamed Manfi, president of the Presidential Council of Libya, said Thursday on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, that the country\u2019s public prosecutor would open an investigation into any possible negligence that contributed to the disaster.\nAs some seek to find who to blame for the catastrophe, a humanitarian disaster is also unfolding for survivors.\nFears are rising of waterborne disease affecting the area, especially with rotting bodies still washing ashore. \u201cAccess to clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities will be required to prevent a further crisis within a crisis,\u201d Elie Abouaoun, country director for Libya at the International Rescue Committee, said in a statement Wednesday.\nAround 30,000 people from Derna are displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration, a U.N. agency.\nSatellite imagery has shown the sheer scale of the destruction wrought by the floods. A government official estimated Wednesday that 25% of the city was completely destroyed or washed away.\nRescue teams from neighboring Egypt and Tunisia have arrived, alongside crews from Turkey, Italy and elsewhere.\nBut their efforts have been hampered by destroyed roads, as well as the interruption of power and communications in the city.\nOthman Abduljaleel, the eastern Libyan government's health minister, said divers were searching seawaters off Derna.\nIn accordance with Islamic tradition, in which bodies are buried as soon as possible, more than 3,000 have already been placed in mass graves, he said.\nThe hope of finding survivors has all but faded as a colossal cleanup and recovery operation begins.\nThe Tripoli Public Services Company began clearing rubble in Derna's previously densely populated center Wednesday in an operation running round the clock, the state-run Libyan News Agency reported.\nIts staff members are divided into three teams: one to remove rubble that may have trapped victims, one to pump out stagnant standing water and one to reopen paths by removing fallen buildings and cars swept away by the floods.\nThe enormous task of providing immediate aid and then rebuilding Derna is complicated by the legacies of a decade of civil conflict, which has left two rival governments ruling eastern and western Libya.\nDerna is controlled by the Libyan National Army, run by Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter and based in the eastern city of Tobruk. The rest of the country is run by the Government of National Unity based in the capital, Tripoli, in the west.\nThis split has hampered reconstructions efforts for years \u2014 though aid workers say both sides are now talking to each other.\n\"Both governments have reached out to the international community requesting services and help,\" Tauhid Pasha, of the International Organization for Migration, told BBC Radio on Wednesday night.\n\"The Government of National Unity has extended its support to us and its request on behalf of the entire country and they are also coordinating with the government in the east,\" he said.\nPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.",

        "text": "The death toll from the unprecedented flooding in northeastern Libya has risen to at least 11,300 people, the U.N. has said, with 10,100 more missing in the devastated city of Derna alone.\nMeanwhile, rescuers, armed with diggers, clawed through debris Sunday to find survivors under the rubble of leveled buildings in Derna, where the previously asphalt roads were awash with wreckage. Bodies are regularly being found amid mangled cars, uprooted palm trees and bits of buildings at the Derna seafront.\nResidents and aid groups gathered the bodies of those who were washed out to sea when historic rain caused two dams to burst and sent millions of cubic meters of floodwater through the center of the city.\n\u201cThese figures are expected to rise as search-and-rescue crews work tirelessly to find survivors,\u201d the United Nations\u2019 Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said of the death toll as of 5 p.m. Saturday (11 a.m. ET).\nThe World Health Organization said 32 tons of health aid \u2014 enough to reach almost 250,000 people \u2014 also arrived Saturday, including essential medicines, trauma and emergency supplies, and medical equipment.\n\u201cThis is a disaster of epic proportions,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Zouiten, a WHO representative in Libya, said in a statement.\nThe aid package also includes body bags for safe and dignified burials of the dead amid fears of the authorities\u2019 rushing to bury people in mass graves.\n\u201cThe bodies of people who have died following wounds sustained in a natural disaster or armed conflict almost never pose a health danger to communities,\u201d the agency said in a separate statement last week, urging for properly documented burials and cremations.\n\u201cThe National Center for Disease Control has already detected at least 55 children poisoned as a result of drinking polluted water in Derna,\u201d said the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nNearly 300,000 children were at soaring risk of diarrhea, cholera, dehydration and malnutrition, according to UNICEF, with nearly every critical infrastructure having been wiped out in the affected areas.\n\u201cChildren are among the most vulnerable and are at high risk of disease outbreaks, lack of safe drinking water, malnutrition, disruption in learning, and violence,\u201d the agency said last week in a statement.\nEntire neighborhoods were swept away last week when Storm Daniel caused two dams to collapse, unleashing on what was a struggling coastal city of 90,000 caught in years of political turmoil.\nExperts have said the disaster, brought on by the deadly mix of torrential rain and poor management of the dams \u2014 or the complete lack of them \u2014 could have been prevented.\nA hydrologist had begun researching the dams protecting the port city about 17 years ago, and the threat the residents faced was well-known, he said.\n\u201cWhen I gathered the data, I found a number of problems in the Derna valley: in the cracks present in the dams, the amount of rainfall and repeated floods,\u201d Abdul Wanis Ashour told Reuters.\n\u201cI found also a number of reports warning of a disaster taking place in the Derna valley basin if the dams were not maintained,\u201d he said.\nThe results of his study, which were published in an academic paper last year, \u201cdemonstrated that the study area has a high potential for flood risk,\u201d calling for immediate steps to enforce regular maintenance and precautionary measures for residents.\n\u201cTherefore, dams of Wadi Derna basin is needed periodic maintenance,\u201d he wrote in the paper.\nAccording to state media, the flooding destroyed at least 891 buildings in Derna.\nThe collapse of the two dams, which were built in the 1970s, will be investigated along with the local officials and previous governments, Libya\u2019s general prosecutor said at a news conference late Friday.\nAshour said: \u201cThere were warnings before that. The state knew of this well, whether through experts in the Public Water Commission or the foreign companies that came to assess the dam.\n\u201cThe Libyan government knew what was going on in the Derna River Valley and the danger of the situation for a very long time.\u201d\nMithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.",

Images showed the region obliterated by raging floodwaters, with cars, masonry and debris strewn across streets and entire buildings swept away.\nThe deluge appeared to have done its worst damage in Derna, a city where at least 5,300 people were confirmed dead, according to the state news agency.\nAnother 6,000 are thought to be missing and over 20,000 have been displaced and left without homes or basic necessities in the coastal city, said Ciar\u00e1n Donnelly, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s senior vice president for crisis response, recovery and development.\nOthman Abduljaleel, the health minister in Libya\u2019s eastern government, described the situation as \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\n\u201cThe bodies are still lying on the ground in many parts.

        "title": "Eight catastrophic floods in 11 days: What\u2019s behind intense rainfall around the world?",
        "text": "The catastrophic flooding in Libya that is feared to have left as many as 10,000 people dead is just the latest in a string of intense rain events to hammer various parts of the globe over the past two weeks.\nIn the first 11 days of September, eight devastating flooding events have unfolded on four continents. Before Mediterranean storm Daniel sent floodwaters surging through eastern Libya, severe rain inundated parts of central Greece, northwestern Turkey, southern Brazil, central and coastal Spain, southern China, Hong Kong and the southwestern U.S.\nSeeing that many unrelated extreme weather events around the world in such a short time is unusual, said Andrew Hoell, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Physical Sciences Laboratory.\n\u201cSometimes we have a clustering of these events, whether it\u2019s in a given country, given hemisphere or globally,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it seems like right now, globally, this is prime time for a number of flooding events.\u201d\nAs with many other forms of extreme weather, scientists say climate change is most likely having an impact on rainfall and flooding, but understanding precisely what that relationship is can be tricky.\nIn general, studies have shown that global warming is intensifying the planet\u2019s water cycle. Warmer temperatures increase evaporation, which means a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. As a result, when storms can unleash more intense precipitation and thus cause severe flooding.\nResearchers have observed those changes over time as the world warms. Since 1901, global precipitation has increased at an average rate of 0.04 inches per decade, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nHowever, a number of factors can influence flooding events and their severity, and teasing out the fingerprints of climate change when they all interact can be challenging, Hoell said.\n\u201cFrom a 1,000-foot view, it\u2019s definitely true that if you have higher temperatures, you have more water vapor, and therefore you can have more precipitation fall from the sky,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you look at a specific event and the specific set of physical processes relevant to that event, it then becomes difficult to attribute every single process in that causal chain.\u201d\nFor one thing, the types of extreme weather that caused each of the eight catastrophic flooding events this month had different origins.\nIt was a Mediterranean storm named Daniel that dumped heavy rain over central Greece and Libya. Typhoon Haikui and its remnants lashed Hong Kong and southern China with record rain, waterlogging urban and rural areas, destroying roads and causing more than 100 landslides.\nTorrential downpours caused flash flooding in central and coastal regions of Spain, northwest Turkey and thousands of miles away in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.\nAnd fast-moving thunderstorms over southern Nevada this month caused flash flooding across the region, swamping the Las Vegas Strip and stranding more than 70,000 people at the Burning Man festival in Black Rock Desert.\nWith certain types of extreme flooding events, such as those associated with Mediterranean cyclones like Daniel, there simply isn't enough data to observe shifts over time.\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have a long enough sample or record to be able to detect a change, because they\u2019re not really that common of an occurrence,\u201d Hoell said.\nIn other cases, local factors, such as how wet or dry the ground is or an area\u2019s basic topography, can have enormous influences on how floods develop \u2014 and their consequences.\nBeyond loss of life and property, floods increase the risks of exposing people to waterborne pathogens, which have important implications for outbreaks of deadly disease.\nHoell said the number of devastating floods this month is distressing, but he said he's especially concerned about the situation unfolding in Libya.\n\u201cIf you look at the damage and the amount of people who have lost their lives,\u201d he said, \u201cit just blows your mind.\u201d\nDenise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change.",

There are mounds of soil where dwellings used to be. But there were no deaths initially reported in Chahak because people have taken shelter in tents this week, fearing for their lives as tremors continue to rock Herat.\nVillagers are distraught over the loss of their homes and livestock, often their only possessions, and worry about the coming harsh winter months. Some said they had never seen an earthquake before and wondered when the shaking of the ground would stop.\nMany said they have no peace of mind inside the tents for fear the \u201cground will open and swallow us at any moment.\u201d\nThe epicenter of Saturday\u2019s quake was about 25 miles northwest of the provincial capital, and several aftershocks have been strong, including another of magnitude 6.3 on Saturday.\nTaliban officials said more than 2,000 had died across Herat after the earlier quakes. They subsequently said the quakes killed and injured thousands but did not give a breakdown of casualties.\nBesides rubble and funerals after Saturday\u2019s devastation, there is little left of the villages in the region\u2019s dusty hills.\nIn Naib Rafi, a village that previously had about 2,500 residents, people said almost no one was still alive besides men who were working outside when the quake struck.

The epicenter was in Zenda Jan district, where 1,294 people died, 1,688 were injured and every home was destroyed, according to U.N. figures.\nWomen and children were more likely to have been at home when the quake struck in the morning, said Siddig Ibrahim, the chief of the UNICEF field office in Herat.\n\u201cWhen the first earthquake hit, people thought it was an explosion, and they ran into their homes,\u201d he said.\nHundreds of people, mostly women, remain missing in Zenda Jan.\nThe Afghanistan representative for the United Nations Population Fund, Jaime Nadal, said there would have been no \u201cgender dimension\u201d to the death toll if the quake had happened at night.\n\u201cAt that time of the day, men were out in the field,\u201d Nadal told The Associated Press. \u201cMany men migrate to Iran for work. The women were at home doing the chores and looking after the children. They found themselves trapped under the rubble. There was clearly a gender dimension.\u201d\nThe initial quake, numerous aftershocks and a second 6.3-magnitude quake on Wednesday flattened entire villages, destroying hundreds of mud-brick homes that could not withstand such force.

The U.N. has provided tents so pregnant women have somewhere to stay and receive care, Nadal said.\nU.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the world body also has provided ambulances to a regional hospital and distributed solar lamps, hygiene kits and other aid to hundreds of displaced families. The World Food Program is sending over 81 tons of food, Dujarric said at U.N. headquarters Thursday.\nMany people inside and outside Herat\u2019s provincial capital are still sleeping outside, even as temperatures drop.\nThe disproportionate impact of the quake on women has left children without mothers, their primary caregivers, raising questions about who will raise them or how to reunite them with fathers who might be out of the province or Afghanistan.\nAid officials say orphanages are non-existent or rare, meaning children who have lost one or both parents are likely to be taken in by surviving relatives or community members.\nEarthquakes are common in Afghanistan, where there are a number of fault lines and frequent movement among three nearby tectonic plates.\nWomen may be at risk of not getting information on earthquake preparedness because of Taliban edicts curtailing their mobility and rights, and restrictions imposed on female humanitarian workers, a U.N. report has warned.\nAuthorities have barred girls from school beyond sixth grade and stopped women from working at nongovernmental groups, although there are exceptions for some sectors like health care. The Taliban also say that women cannot travel long distances without male chaperones.\nAid agencies say their female Afghan staff members are \u201cfor now\u201d working freely in Herat and reaching women and girls affected by the earthquake.\nUNICEF has launched a $20 million appeal to help the estimated 13,000 children and families devastated by the earthquake.",

The death toll spiked from 500 reported earlier on Sunday by the Red Crescent.\nTen rescue teams were in the area, which borders Iran, Sayeeq told a news conference.\nMore than 200 dead have been brought to various hospitals, said a Herat health department official who identified himself as Dr. Danish, adding that most of them were women and children.\nBodies were \u201ctaken to several places \u2014 military bases, hospitals,\u201d Danish said.\nBeds were set up outside the main hospital in Herat to receive a flood of victims, photos on social media showed.\nFood, drinking water, medicine, clothes and tents were urgently needed for rescue and relief, Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban political office in Qatar, said in a message to the media.\nThe medieval minarets of Herat sustained some damage, photographs on social media showed, with cracks visible and tiles fallen off.\nHemmed in by mountains, Afghanistan has a history of strong earthquakes, many in the rugged Hindu Kush region bordering Pakistan.\nDeath tolls often rise when information comes in from more remote parts of a country where decades of war have left infrastructure in a shambles, and relief and rescue operations difficult to organize.\nAfghanistan\u2019s health care system, reliant almost entirely on foreign aid, has faced crippling cuts in the two years since the Taliban took over and much international assistance, which had formed the backbone of the economy, was halted.\nDiplomats and aid officials say concerns over Taliban restrictions on women and competing global humanitarian crises are causing donors to pull back on financial support. The Islamist government has ordered most Afghan female aid staff not to work, although with exemptions in health and education.\nIn August, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was likely to end its financial support for 25 Afghan hospitals because of funding constraints. It was not immediately clear whether the Herat hospital was on that list.\nThe quakes set off panic in Herat, resident Naseema said.\n\u201cPeople left their houses, we all are on the streets,\u201d she wrote in a text message to Reuters on Saturday, adding that the city was feeling aftershocks.\nThere are a total of 202 public health facilities in Herat province, one of which is the major regional hospital where 500 casualties were taken, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a report on Sunday.\nA vast majority of the facilities are smaller basic health centers and logistical challenges are hindering operations, particularly in remote areas, the WHO said.\n\u201cWhile search and rescue operations remain ongoing, casualties in these areas have not yet been fully identified,\u201d it said.",

While in still another, a family huddled inside a hotel room shower to escape breaking windows and fierce wind.\nOtis is stronger than Hurricane Pauline that hit Acapulco in 1997, L\u00f3pez said. Pauline destroyed swaths of the city and killed more than 200 people. Hundreds of others were injured in flooding and mudslides.\nBetween the internationally known resorts of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo are two dozen small towns and villages perched between the mountains and the ocean.\nOtis\u2019 arrival came just days after Hurricane Norma struck the southern tip of Mexico\u2019s Baja California Peninsula to the north.\nAcapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the city\u2019s hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. The city had opened two dozen shelters in the hours before Otis made landfall.\nGuerrero is one of Mexico\u2019s most impoverished and violent states. Just Monday, a local police chief and 12 police officers were massacred and found on a highway in El Papayo, which is in the Guerrero township of Coyuca de Benitez not far from Otis\u2019 impact zone.\nIn the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy continued moving northeastward over open water with winds of 100 mph (155 kph) after sweeping through the Lesser Antilles over the weekend. Tammy was located about 540 miles south-southeast of Bermuda. The storm was expected to become a powerful extratropical cyclone by Thursday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.",

        "title": "Hurricane Otis: How a tropical storm turned into a 'nightmare scenario' overnight",
        "text": "In a single day, Hurricane Otis went from a nuisance to a monster.\nOtis, which made landfall near Acapulco, Mexico, on Wednesday morning as a Category 5 hurricane, \u201cexplosively intensified\u201d by about 115 mph in just 24 hours, according to the National Hurricane Center, which called it a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d for southern Mexico.\nOnly one other storm in recorded history \u2014 2015\u2019s Hurricane Patricia \u2014 has eclipsed that mark, it said in a forecast Tuesday night.\n\u201cImagine starting your day expecting a stiff breeze and some rain, and overnight you get catastrophic 165 mph winds,\u201d Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science, wrote on X. \u201cJust 24 hours prior, it was a tropical storm and was forecast to make landfall as a tropical storm.\u201d\nOtis\u2019 stunning intensification made it the strongest hurricane to have made landfall in Mexico in recorded history. The storm has weakened to a Category 2 hurricane, but strong winds, heavy rainfall and flash flooding will continue to hammer parts of southern Mexico.\nThe National Hurricane Center said 8 to 16 inches of rain are expected, with up to 20 inches through Thursday across Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.\nThe hurricane\u2019s incredible ramp-up fits with a pattern scientists are following with concern. In recent years, a larger percentage of tropical storms have rapidly intensified as they approached landfall, meaning they gained at least 35 mph wind speed in 24 hours. The intensification is fueled by warm water on the ocean\u2019s surface, which provides extra energy for the storm.\nIn recent months, the world\u2019s oceans have shattered temperature records, with multiple bodies of water in the grips of marine heat waves.\nMcNoldy said on X that Hurricane Otis \u201ctook full advantage of a warm patch of ocean,\u201d moving over waters that were roughly 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) late Tuesday as it neared Acapulco.\nScientists have said rapidly intensifying storms are likely to be more common as a result of climate change. In recent years, the prediction appears to be playing out with alarming accuracy. Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Hurricane Laura in 2020 and Hurricane Ida in 2021 all rapidly intensified before they made landfall. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian\u2019s peak winds increased from 150 mph to 185 mph in only nine hours.\nLast year, Hurricane Ian underwent two separate rounds of rapid intensification before it caused catastrophic destruction in southwestern Florida. And more recently, Hurricane Idalia in late August and Hurricane Lee in September both gained speed and power at breakneck pace.\nScientists are still puzzled by the factors that lead to rapid intensification. Climate change\u2019s warming of ocean waters could be playing a role. Improvements in satellite technology have also increased scientists\u2019 ability to track storms, which could make it easier to identify the trend.\nA study published last week in the journal Scientific Reports found that tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were about 29% more likely to undergo rapid intensification from 2001 to 2020, compared to 1971 to 1990. In recent times, more than twice as many hurricanes went from Category 1 or weaker to Category 3 or stronger in 36 hours, the study found.\n\u201cPredicting rapid intensification remains one of the hardest problems in hurricane forecasting,\u201d Robert Rohde, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote on X. \u201cThis is a catastrophic miss.\u201d\nThe hurricane center was forecasting life-threatening storm surge along the coast of southern Mexico on Wednesday. It expected destructive winds and heavy precipitation to continue further inland, producing mudslides and flash floods.\nEvan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Ground zero of Japan\u2019s earthquake zone is ravaged by destruction and fire",
        "text": "WAJIMA, Japan \u2014 The fishing town of Wajima is destroyed almost beyond recognition. Buildings and houses have toppled into nearly every street, and the historic market at the center of the town has been wiped out.\nWhen the powerful 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck here on New Year\u2019s Day, the tremors brought down the market\u2019s power lines and most of its 200 wooden shops and houses. Then, a massive and unforgiving fire took hold, incinerating everything in its path.\nWithin hours, the market that had stood for centuries was reduced to heaps of ash, charred wood and twisted metal. Days later, when we visited, it was still smoldering.\nOur journey to Wajima took us along buckled roads with yawning gaps that left some unpassable. Some roads were blocked by huge boulders or mounds of earth from landslides, creating chokepoints and long lines of traffic. A drive that would normally take an hour took six.\nTraveling through the mountains and up the coast allowed us to take in the scale of what happened. Every village we passed was damaged and appeared eerily empty of people. The tsunami warning forced extensive evacuations, and few people had yet to return. Officials have urged people to stay away from their homes for now because of the high risk of another strong earthquake.\nIn Kuroshima, a protected historic site on the outskirts of Wajima, the temples and traditional wood buildings had been through many earthquakes before. But the force of this one was different, leaving several of the old structures in ruins. Like many communities across the Noto peninsula, most of the residents are elderly.\n\u201cThey may not have the energy, resources or time to rebuild,\u201d one man told us. \u201cThe sense of loss is quite profound.\u201d\nLooking out toward the sea offered signs of how Japan\u2019s landscape had been altered there, too. Experts say the tectonic shifts from the quake pushed the ground up 13 feet in some areas and moved it sideways by more than 3 feet. The ocean floor is now higher.\nFrom Kuroshima, you can see a breakwall, but there is water on only one side of it. The local port appears to have shifted up and over, we were told, making it too shallow for local fishermen. There is also now a wide expanse of beach that did not exist before.\nWajima straddles a cove on the peninsula, just 20 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake, the strongest to rock the country in nearly 12 years. There have been more than 600 aftershocks, according to Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency, that have knocked out water infrastructure and electricity. Outside a recreation hall now being used as an evacuation center, the clock is stuck at 4:10 p.m. \u2014 when the biggest of the earthquakes hit.\nThe death toll has reached 126, according to officials, and more than 200 people remain unaccounted for or trapped in the rubble. Experts talk about a 72-hour window to reach survivors, and that deadline has now passed.\nStill, rescue crews are being urged by Japan\u2019s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to keep trying to save as many lives as possible. On Thursday, an 87-year-old woman was pulled from under the collapsed first floor of her house here where she had been trapped and conscious for days. Aftershocks are complicating recovery efforts, as is the cold and rainy weather.\nThere are thousands of military and police personnel working with dogs and helicopters as part of the search and recovery effort. In Wajima, teams are going door to door checking for survivors and looking for bodies. We watched one crew in yellow and blue uniforms carefully remove pieces of debris from the entrance of a heavily damaged house. They called out, then used tools to pry open the door, their flashlights glowing through windows with shattered glass and blowing curtains. They found nothing, or no one, and moved on to the next site.\nMore than 10,000 people in Wajima alone are living in evacuation centers. The need is vast, and supplies have been slowly trickling in. Volunteers are making meals and serving coffee, and sharing what they have with those who need it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making over a thousand meals a day,\u201d one volunteer said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to help.\u201d\nAs the rain stopped and the day was losing light, I walked around the wasteland of the market, past burned-out cars and under fallen power lines. A few taller buildings are still standing but marred by fire. We had heard that several people that night sought refuge there from the possible tsunami, then became trapped by the fire.\nJapan is a country well prepared for earthquake disasters, but it could take years to pick up the pieces here and likely longer to recover. At an intersection in Wajima, there is a seven-floor building that has fallen on its side. Its balconies and windows are still mostly intact, and the traffic light pinned underneath is still diligently working.\nJanis Mackey Frayer is a Beijing-based correspondent for NBC News.",

        "title": "Japan reports dozens of fatalities after series of strong earthquakes",
        "text": "TOKYO \u2014 Japan was struck by a series of powerful earthquakes on New Year's Day that killed at least 48 people, reduced hundreds of buildings to rubble, and forced tens of thousands to flee to higher ground.\nDozens of survivors were being treated at hospitals across the Ishikawa prefecture and the emergency rooms were expected to become even more crowded as rescue crews free people believed to be still trapped in the ruins of homes and buildings.\nThe Japanese public broadcaster NHK TV summed-up the situation with a grim headline: \"Homes have collapsed, there are people unconscious.\"\nPotentially complicating the rescue efforts was a forecast that could include snow Tuesday in this region some 325 miles west of Tokyo, and the fact that so many roads have been damaged that manpower and supplies may have to be delivered by boat.\nMeanwhile, firefighters were battling blazes that devoured some 50 buildings in a market area within the city of Wajima, NHK reported, citing Ishikawa officials.\nThose buildings were believed to be largely unoccupied when, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the quakes hit off the Ishikawa coast a little after 4 p.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), with one reaching a magnitude of 7.6.\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters he would personally lead the nation's disaster response and has already been in touch with the mayors of Wajima and Suzu, which is another city on the Noto Peninsula hit hard by the quakes.\nNot long after, the White House issued a statement pledging to help Japan if needed.\n\"My administration is in touch with Japanese officials, and the United States stands ready to provide any necessary assistance for the Japanese people,\" President Joe Biden said.\nSo far, three of the reported deaths \u2014 two in Nanao City and one in Shika Town \u2014 were due to building collapses, Japanese broadcaster NTV reported, citing information from local police. Eight people were confirmed dead and seven people were seriously injured in Wajima city, according to NHK. The two other deaths were reported in unspecified locations.\nKishida said search-and-rescue teams have been dispatched to the stricken cities, but manpower and supplies might have to be brought in by boat because many roads in the area are damaged.\nAlso, large swaths of the area were without power, water or cellphone service as a result of the quakes, Kishida said.\n\u201cAs the casualties are starting to become apparent, it is now a race against time,\" Kishida said at a news conference. \"We must work on rescuing everyone, especially those buried under collapsed buildings. I call on all to utilize all available methods, including deploying the Self-Defense Force, and to do everything possible to expedite the recovery and repair of damaged infrastructure as soon as possible.\u201d\nTsunami warnings had been issued in the wake of the quakes in Ishikawa as well as the coastal prefectures of Niigata and Toyama, where 33,000 buildings had lost power as of 6 p.m. (4 a.m. ET), according to the Hokuriku Electric Power company.\nThe Japanese public broadcaster NHK TV warned the quakes could churn-up 17-foot tall waves and urged people on the entire west coast to evacuate.\nThose tsunami warnings were lifted later Monday and, thus far, the tallest wave reported was around 4 feet tall and detected at the port in the city of Wajima, the broadcaster reported.\nThe quakes were so powerful they were felt on the other side of the country in Tokyo, according to the broadcaster.\nA video posted to X showed a train station in Kanazawa, the capital of Ishikawa Prefecture, shaking and losing power during an earthquake. Another showed a family clinging on to whatever they could as their apartment in Kanazawa rocked wildly.\nOther videos posted to social media showed houses in some areas with roofs caved in and door frames falling off while surrounding trees fall to the ground. In some supermarkets, goods were scattered as the ground shook.\nIn Wajima, the quake flattened a lacquerware company and at least 30 homes in the city, trapping dozens of people under the rubble, NHK reported, citing the local fire department and a statement from the local government.\nSeveral people with minor head or other injuries from falling objects were treated at Wajima Municipal Hospital, officials there said.\nIn Nanao City, which is located on the same peninsula, landslides, cracked roads, and collapsed homes were also reported, local police said.\nIn Suzu, the collapse of a two-story house was caught on camera by an NHK crew. Other footage showed one large isolated wave crashing off the coast of the city.\nEarlier, Japanese officials announced it was sending military assistance to the hardest-hit areas but none of the nuclear reactors operating in the region had been damaged.\nTrain service in and out of the area was suspended and the airport that serves the cities on the Noto Peninsula was shut down.\nArata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, Larissa Gao reported from Hong Kong, and Corky Siemaszko from New York City.\nArata Yamamoto has been a NBC News producer in Tokyo since 1993.\nLarissa Gao is a fellow on NBC\u2019s Asia Desk, based in Hong Kong.\nCorky Siemaszko is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital.",

        "text": "The United States said Friday it was preparing military logistical support and aid for regions in Japan devastated by an earthquake that killed 126 people, forced about 33,000 people to leave their homes, and left over 200 people unaccounted for.\n\u201cThe U.S. is here to support our friend and ally in its earthquake response. Military logistical support, food, and other supplies are being readied,\u201d U.S. ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel posted on social media site X.\nJapan is in talks with the U.S. about emergency assistance and rejected offers for help from other countries including China for the time being.\n\u201cWe are not accepting any personnel or material aid from other countries or regions at the moment given the situation on the ground and the effort that would be required to receive them,\u201d Japan\u2019s top spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi said.\nA U.S. official who declined to be named told Reuters the two governments were coordinating on possible assistance from U.S. troops.\nAbout 54,000 U.S. forces personnel are based in Japan, the biggest U.S. military presence abroad, according to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\nU.S. armed forces were deeply involved in disaster relief efforts in the 2011 earthquake, providing over 24,000 personnel with 24 ships and 189 aircraft. They also provided earthquake aid in Kyushu island in 2016.\n\u201cAll of U.S. Forces Japan remain ready to support our Japanese Allies during this difficult time. We are unable to provide specifics on military support operations at this time, but we will provide updates when we have more that we can share,\u201d the U.S. Forces in Japan said in a statement.\nThe 7.6 magnitude quake struck western Japan\u2019s Noto peninsula on the afternoon of New Year\u2019s Day, flattening homes, triggering a tsunami and cutting off remote communities.\nAs the emergency response moved from rescue to aid and recovery, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said there were offers for help and messages of condolence from governments including Taiwan and China.\nThe full extent of the damage remains unclear, with rescue teams struggling to reach remote areas due to severed roads and broken infrastructure.\nBut with more than 200 people missing, the disaster is likely deadlier than the 2016 earthquake and could be the worst since a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the east coast of Japan in 2011.\nShigeru Sakaguchi, the mayor of badly-hit Wajima city, said there are likely more than 100 people still trapped under collapsed buildings and rubble, according to the Mainichi newspaper.\nThe U.S. will provide a $100,000 aid package that includes resources such as blankets, water, and medical supplies, according to a statement released by its embassy in Japan.\nVolunteers such as Aydin Muhammet, who is usually based in Nagoya, are also heading into areas wrecked by the tremor to give whatever aid they can provide.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t turn a blind eye after seeing that ... I felt like I had to go, I just had to do something,\u201d he said.\nAt least 296 acres of land also appears to be flooded from a tsunami triggered by the earthquake, according to Japan\u2019s land ministry.\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have a full picture, and it\u2019s likely that the area flooded by the tsunami could spread,\u201d an unnamed land ministry official said to the daily Asahi newspaper.\nA preliminary probe led by researchers at the University of Tokyo estimated that the highest point of the tsunami on the western coast of the peninsula could have reached up to 14 feet above normal sea level.\nThe first wave of the tsunami may have reached the northern-most tip of the Noto peninsula within a minute of the initial quake, according to Tohoku University tsunami expert Fumihiko Imamura, giving residents barely any time to evacuate.\nDetails of the tsunami had been unclear as the tide gauge stopped emitting data immediately after the initial quake, Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency said.\nJapan\u2019s Coast Guard said it was searching one missing person who was washed away by tsunami in Suzu city, the first known potential casualty from the tsunami so far.\nSurvivors still face a long road to recovery, even as businesses rush to return to business as usual. The earthquake has also cast doubt over Japan\u2019s push to restart nuclear plants that have been idled.\nJapan will spend 4.74 billion yen ($32.7 million) from state budget reserves to support those hit by the quake, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters on Friday, according to media reports.",

A list of those officially missing released overnight grew from 15 to 51 people in three cities, including a 13-year-old boy. Some earlier reported missing have been found but more names were coming in, officials said.\nIshikawa prefecture and nearby areas were shaken by more aftershocks, adding to the dozens that followed Monday\u2019s magnitude 7.6 temblor centered near Noto, about 185 miles from Tokyo on the opposite coast. The quake set off tsunami warnings, followed by waves measuring more than 3 feet in some places.\n\u201cMore than 40 hours have passed. This is a race against time, and I feel that we are at a critical moment,\u201d Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, he announced that the number of troops dispatched for rescue operations is increasing from about 1,000 to 4,600.\nThe narrowness of the Noto Peninsula has added to the challenges in reaching some communities.

Sniffer dogs joined military personnel and firefighters in the search.\nWeather forecasters warned of heavy rain in Ishikawa, leading to worries about landslides and further damage to half-crumbled homes. Temperatures were expected to drop to around 36 degrees Fahrenheit overnight.\nIshikawa officials raised the death toll on Thursday to 78. Of the dead, 44 people were in Wajima and 23 in Suzu, with the rest in five towns.\nMore than 330 people have been injured, at least 25 of them seriously.\nIshikawa Gov. Hiroshi Hase encouraged everyone to use masks, antiseptic and soap to guard against the spread of infectious diseases as evacuees shelter together.

The shaking threw him to the ground, and a concrete wall came crashing down, barely missing him, he said.\nHe was eating only rice balls and a few sips of water in paper cups at the elementary school where he and others have been sheltering. They slept on cushions, with no blankets.\n\u201cIt was so cold. I thought I\u2019d freeze to death,\u201d he said.\nIn the aftermath of the quakes and tsunami, boats lay overturned in the sea, roads were blocked by mounds of dirt, and pillars and walls lay scattered from flattened homes. A large fire turned an entire section of Wajima city into ashes.\nJapan is prone to earthquakes, with many fault lines and volcanoes. A massive quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in 2011 caused widespread damage in northeastern Japan.\nNo major problems were reported at nuclear plants after Monday\u2019s quake. The Shika nuclear plant in Ishikawa suffered a partial electricity failure, but backup power kicked in, ensuring the critical cooling process continued.\nJapan is an organized, conformist and relatively crime-free society where warnings are systematically relayed as a public service. Disaster experts say that\u2019s helping save lives.\nTakako Izumi, a disaster science professor at Tohoku University, said time is needed to figure out logistics because roads are often blocked after an earthquake, and large trucks can\u2019t get through to deliver aid.\nIf land routes aren\u2019t accessible, aid may have to be dropped from the sky or brought in by boat. The winter cold adds to health risks, and some people may still have not reached an evacuation center, she added.\n\u201cWe need to accurately assess the damage first. And then a proper response can come, and what\u2019s needed can reach the right places,\u201d Izumi said.",

On Sunday Toh\u00e1 added that more than 1,350 homes have already been affected.\nBoric has issued an order for two days of national mourning for the forest fires victims \u2014 both those who have lost loved ones and those who have lost their property.\nIn a virtual address, Boric acknowledged the loss of life and homes and promised Chileans that the government was actively working to provide resources.\n\u201cI know that it is a very difficult time to lose the house that was built with so many years of sacrifice,\u201d the president said. \u201cLosing a family member, a loved one, is a heartbreak impossible to measure, but rest assured that our government is deployed with all the human, technical and budgetary resources.\u201d\nThe fires triggered evacuations in several regions of central Chile.\nIn February 2023, fires in the country swept through more than 400,000 hectares and killed more than 22 people.\nThough this year\u2019s fires have not spread as widely, Toh\u00e1 said they are \u201cmultiplying rapidly\u201d and are spreading closer to urban areas, so the potential to affect more people and structures is \u201cvery high.\u201d\nThe fires broke out as Chile faces a heat wave that has affected other Latin American countries as well.\nBoric declared a state of emergency, and red alerts were issued for at-risk areas. The Education Ministry has established 20 shelters in the regions of Valpara\u00edso, O\u2019Higgins and Los Lagos.\nBoric also flew over the region to assess the affected areas. \u201cWe have worked to have the greatest resources in our history to face the wildfire season and deploy them from day one to prevent (forest fires) and help people,\u201d he said.\nNineteen helicopters and more than 450 firefighters have been brought into the area to combat the blazes. Additionally, all mass commercial events in Valpara\u00edso were suspended \u2014 including sporting, recreational and cultural events \u2014 in order to focus efforts on the fires.\n\u201cEvery time there is a massive event, that means a demand for security teams and authorities who are distracted from what is central today,\u201d Toh\u00e1 said. \u201cThat is why we need there to be no distraction.\u201d\nEsval, a Chile-based water utilities company, said its teams were working to stabilize service in order to \u201csupply and boost water in fire zones.\u201d In a news release, Esval regional manager Alejandro Salas also encouraged customers to postpone nonurgent tasks such as washing clothes and watering gardens.\nA curfew was extended for the towns of Quilpu\u00e9, Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Linache and Villa Alemana until Sunday to allow clearer routes for operational teams to maneuver and for evacuations to take place.\nJoe Kottke is a researcher at the NBC News Network Desk.",

        "text": "In December 2022, Clay Trauernicht led several dozen federal wildfire officials down a long road on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island to show them the site of the largest fire in state history. It could happen again, he warned.\nA lush green mountain was visible in the distance, but Trauernicht, a University of Hawaii fire scientist, was focused on the dry brown grass at his feet. A fire the year before had burned 42,000 acres, as firefighters struggled to contain it for more than four days. It destroyed some of the state\u2019s prized, and dwindling, native ecosystems. Many of the native plants were gone for good, he said, but the invasive grass that burned in that fire was already primed to burn again.\n\u201cThe fire that we saw that ripped across the landscape here, we\u2019re getting into situations where we\u2019re beyond the capacity that we currently have,\u201d he told the gathered officials. More fires would be coming, he said, making prevention \u2014 like trimming tall plants and breaking up big areas of flammable grass \u2014 key. \u201cWe have to figure this out.\u201d\nClay Trauernicht stands in a field of invasive Guinea grass near University of Hawaii at Manoa. (Josiah Patterson for NBC News)\nClay Trauernicht stands in a field of invasive Guinea grass near University of Hawaii at Manoa. (Josiah Patterson for NBC News)\nHe had given the same warnings three years earlier to a group of state legislative staffers on another trip to a fire site on Maui. After both fires, local firefighters had told him the fires burned bigger, faster and hotter than they had ever seen. Wildfire in the Hawaiian Islands was changing.\nWhen Trauernicht was hired by the University of Hawaii in 2013 and began analyzing the state\u2019s fire data, he quickly saw that the frequency of fires had been rising since the 1990s. But the tropical state still officially considered wildfire a \u201clow\u201d to \u201cmedium\u201d risk compared to other natural disasters.\nHe began a campaign to sound the alarm, along with a handful of others focused on wildfire prevention in the state. Over the next decade, Trauernicht gave dozens of talks to officials and community groups, wrote articles and spoke to the press after every major fire, always saying the same thing: Hawaii has a new wildfire reality and needs to start prioritizing prevention and management.\nBut that didn\u2019t happen. In August 2023, the Lahaina fire killed at least 100 people and caused unprecedented devastation. Rebuilding will cost an estimated $5.5 billion. While the extent of the damage surprised even Trauernicht, the location did not.\nHomes and buildings burned to the ground by wildfire in Lahaina last August. (Patrick T.

Fallon / AFP - Getty Images)\nThe areas where the Lahaina fire spread fastest and burned hottest were like the site Trauernicht showed federal officials on the Big Island months before \u2014 covered in invasive African grasses that evolved to burn and quickly grow again. First imported in the 1800s for agricultural purposes, the highly flammable grasses, sometimes 12 feet tall, now blanket abandoned plantations across the islands.\nSince 1999, there have been 13 fires within a 3-mile radius of Lahaina, as many as five in the same spot, according to an NBC News analysis of state fire perimeter data that was compiled by Trauernicht\u2019s lab.\nResearchers began consistently tracking wildfire boundaries in Hawaii in 1999. The number of fires and amount of land burned has increased in the 25 years since.\nOn Maui alone, nearly as much land has burned in the last five years as the previous 20 combined, much of it near communities on the west side of the island.\n\u201cWe started putting out information about this in 2014,\u201d said Trauernicht, who noted that fire frequency and severity has only increased since then. \u201cThis is not [just] a Lahaina problem. They just got the worst outcome you can imagine.\u201d\nChris Speicher has sold real estate on Maui for more than five years. Clients might ask about hurricanes, but rarely fire, he said. People don\u2019t associate it with Hawaii.\n\u201cFire risk is something that should be openly talked about,\u201d Speicher said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a surprise to people.\u201d\nLike many of his clients, Speicher said he didn\u2019t realize just how dry parts of the islands could be when he first moved to the West Maui coast, where Lahaina is located, in 2018. \u201cWest Maui is only green a couple of months a year. The rest of the time it\u2019s like a desert,\u201d he said. West Maui had always been dry, but as its carefully maintained plantations of sugarcane and pineapple \u2014 both tropical plants \u2014 shut down, it became covered in nonnative, difficult-to-remove flammable grasses.\nDry buffelgrass in Lahaina.

(Matt McClain / The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nOver the next five years, Speicher was evacuated five times from three different West Maui homes due to nearby wildfires.\nJust a few months after he arrived on the island, a wildfire caused by high wind from Hurricane Lane burned through more than 2,000 acres, including parts of Lahaina, and caused approximately $4 million in damage. Speicher\u2019s home survived the fire, but two neighbors lost their houses.\nIn August 2023, Speicher was living in Kaanapali, just north of Lahaina, when his family received another evacuation order, once again for a wildfire influenced by hurricane winds.\nSpeicher said he didn\u2019t feel any better prepared, though his home survived. His family returned to it, but was evacuated twice more for nearby fires in the next three weeks. The third time was the last straw for Speicher and his wife, who made what they called a \u201cgut wrenching\u201d decision to leave Hawaii altogether. They were tired of having to be on constant alert in case a fire broke out, he said. They continue to sell Maui property, but now live in Maryland.\nChris Speicher, right, at his home in Kaanapali, Maui, with friend Joe Schilling.

Speicher safely evacuated his home during the 2023 Maui wildfires. Schilling died in the Lahaina fire.\nA federal analysis of wildfire risk to communities shows that of all 50 states, Hawaii has by far the highest risk of \u201cfire consequence\u201d \u2014 the likelihood of high-intensity fires near homes.\n\u201cWhen we did this modeling four years ago and we saw how high Hawaii was ranking, we questioned ourselves and really thought, \u2018Can this be right?\u2019\u201d said Joe Scott, one of the lead researchers of the analysis and head of Pyrologix, a wildfire risk research firm. His team ran the numbers again. \u201cWe were very surprised by this result, but we couldn\u2019t find a reason it was wrong.\u201d\nNearly six months after the August wildfires, Speicher says there\u2019s a lack of guidance on what Maui\u2019s fire emergency response will look like in the future.\n\u201cThey [government officials] haven\u2019t even said, \u2018If there\u2019s a fire, here\u2019s what we are going to do,\u2019\u201d Speicher said. \u201cThe most frustrating thing is that the fire in 2018 almost burned Lahaina to the ground.\u201d\nWhen fire hit the Lahaina area in the middle of the night in 2018, more than 100 homes were evacuated. Officials at the time said it was nothing short of a miracle that the fire did not consume the whole town.\nIn the aftermath, an angry crowd of community members confronted Maui officials at a town hall, demanding to know why the siren system had not been activated.\nThere was no protocol for fire sirens, the officials said. But they could potentially look into making one.\nBut a new siren protocol never came. And a long-promised report on the emergency response to the 2018 fire had yet to be released five years later when fire came to Lahaina again. Hawaii\u2019s then-most recent emergency management plan still labeled wildfire risk statewide as \u201clow\u201d to \u201cmedium.\u201d\nThe hall of historic Waiola Church in Lahaina and nearby Lahaina Hongwanji Mission are engulfed in flames on Aug. 8, 2023.

(Matthew Thayer/The Maui News via AP)\nOnce again, in August 2023, government officials chose not to sound the emergency warning sirens, a decision Maui\u2019s then-emergency management chief defended. The warning system was set up for tsunami events, not fire, he said, so officials were concerned people might have tried to seek higher ground and run toward the fire instead of away from it.\nA few months later, Maui County finally released a draft report on its emergency response to the 2018 fire amid public pressure. It contained no mentions of sirens in its improvement plan for future disasters.\nMaui County referred questions about emergency siren protocols after the 2023 wildfires to Hawaii\u2019s Emergency Management Agency, which told NBC News that siren activation \u201cin case of fires is primarily the responsibility of our counties.\u201d\nIn response to questions about future wildfires, a spokesperson for Maui County said the county has spent \u201ca considerable amount of time in recent months focusing on response efforts for wildfires and other potentially hazardous emergency situations\u201d and noted that its fire department has been advocating to increase wildfire preparedness measures, including evacuation plans, for years.\nThe 2021 Mana Road fire on Hawaii's Big Island burned 42,000 acres. (Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources)\nThe 2021 Mana Road fire on Hawaii's Big Island burned 42,000 acres. (Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources)\nMore big fires have meant increasing awareness of fire risk on the islands, said Elizabeth Pickett, co-executive director of Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, but preparation and prevention are lagging far behind.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no money,\u201d said Pickett. \u201cIt\u2019s just a small cohort of people who\u2019ve been trying to make this stuff happen in the absence of legislation, regulation and money.\u201d\nPickett\u2019s nonprofit was founded in 2000, at the request of the state\u2019s overburdened forestry and fire agencies, to handle much of the fire prevention work that government agencies typically do in large Western states. Today, the nonprofit spends most of its effort training land managers around the state on prevention measures like breaking up large swaths of dry, overgrown invasive grass via grazing, creating fire breaks and restoring native plants.\nThe nonprofit gets money from the state and county governments, and from foundations, but despite years of sounding the alarm alongside Trauernicht and requesting more funds, Pickett said those grants have only slightly increased.\n\u201cVery few funders understand what it really takes to meet, prevent and mitigate wildfire,\u201d said Pickett, whose group collaborates with state agencies and conducts community fire education and wildfire research.\nHistorically, Hawaii saw fire so infrequently that its ecosystems are not adapted to it. Lightning-caused fires are not as common as they are in the mainland U.S., so most fires are usually the result of human activity.\nThe state\u2019s native ecosystems would generally have expected to see a fire every 100 to 200 years.\nBut increasingly frequent and large fires are \u201cnow our new normal,\u201d said Allyson Earl, a fire researcher who works for the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization and the University of Hawaii.\nWildfire specialist Clay Trauernicht stands with remote sensing research specialist Allyson Earl in a field of invasive Guinea grass near the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Behind them is Wa\u02bbahila ridge, also covered in invasive grass, which has burned three times in the last decade. (Josiah Patterson for NBC News)\nFires are now as frequent as every one to five years in some places, data shows. That shift is a result of a number of factors, but changes in land use and management in the last half-century have had the biggest impact, Earl and other fire researchers say.\nThe change began with the introduction of large-scale agriculture in the 1800s. Agribusiness took over huge areas of the islands for cattle grazing, sugarcane and pineapple plantations. But the industry began declining in the second half of the 1900s as production costs were higher than abroad, and much of that land became fallow fields covered in invasive plants, particularly tall, flammable grasses.\nAs the grasses spread, uninhibited, they created ecosystems \u201ctopsy-turvy to Hawaii,\u201d said David Burney, a professor of conservation paleobiology at the Makauwahi Cave Reserve on Kauai. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a new fire regime in a lot of places. \u2026 The difference between an ecosystem that burns every 100 years and a place that burns every five years is like day to night.\u201d\nClimate change and population growth have added to that growing risk, according to the state\u2019s researchers. Hawaii\u2019s seasonal patterns are shifting, making dry seasons drier and fires larger and more likely, said Earl. While most fires occur on the drier sides of the islands, like West Maui, even areas with more precipitation are seeing increases.\nEach of Hawaii\u2019s four counties has an organization focused on trying to prevent the spread of fire-prone grasses. But the groups are small, and the plants, like fountain grass, buffelgrass and Guinea grass, are widespread.\n\u201cThese are not easy grasses to manage,\u201d said Franny Kinslow Brewer, program manager at the Big Island Invasive Species Committee. They are tall, sharp and full of stinging, glasslike fibers that require special tools to remove. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can just get on a little ride-around mower and just trim down.\u201d\nA member of the Big Island Invasive Species Committee surveys invasive elephant grass, left, and Allyson Earl holds invasive Guinea grass near the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

(Big Island Invasive Species Committee; Josiah Patterson for NBC News)\nHer group and its counterparts go door to door to help control invasive grass on private lawns. But not everyone is interested in their help, and even if they were, the small teams can\u2019t reach the whole state.\nWhen criticized over grass management in the past, large landowners have pushed back, saying they maintain their land consistent with county fire codes, including by establishing fire breaks, which are barriers of cleared land.\nMany communities around the state are now surrounded by large swaths of these \u201cfire-loving\u201d grasses, said Burney, who has studied prehistoric fires and climate in Hawaii and urged communities to prepare. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why something like Lahaina won\u2019t happen again and again.\u201d\nIn the aftermath of the Maui fires, the state has begun to take steps toward wildfire preparedness. A November emergency management report updated Hawaii\u2019s overall wildfire hazard from \u201cmedium\u201d to \u201chigh.\u201d It listed Maui County as the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d in the state, with almost half its population living in high wildfire-risk areas.\nThe same month, Hawaii\u2019s House of Representatives published a report of recommendations for wildfire relief, preparation and prevention for the upcoming legislative session. The county is working with the state emergency management agency to update its wildfire preparedness plan. And the Biden administration and Congress have allocated millions of dollars to reconstruct electrical grids to reduce Hawaii\u2019s fire risk.\nBut prevention is still woefully underfunded \u2014 substantial new money for Pickett and Trauernicht\u2019s work has yet to materialize. In the months following the fire, they received more attention than they ever had, including more requests to consult and share their expertise than they could handle. They have submitted proposals to federal grant programs and are watching bills in the state legislature that would provide money to expand their capacity, but for now it\u2019s a waiting game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get anything off the ground because the things that need to happen are these major investments,\u201d Pickett said.\nAfter saying the same thing for a decade only to see the devastation of the Maui fires, Trauernicht has been left grieving and angry.\n\u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing you want to say is, \u2018We said this was going to happen,\u2019 right? Like the crazy guys in the movies pointing at the asteroid.\u201d",
