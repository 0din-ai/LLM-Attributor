    "2023 Hawaii wildfires": [
        "In early August 2023, a series of wildfires broke out in the U.S. state of Hawaii, predominantly on the island of Maui. The wind-driven fires prompted evacuations, caused widespread damage, killing at least 100 people and leaving four persons missing in the town of Lahaina on Maui's northwest coast. The proliferation of the wildfires was attributed to dry, gusty conditions created by a strong high-pressure area north of Hawaii and Hurricane Dora to the south.",
        "An emergency declaration was signed on August 8, authorizing several actions, including activation of the Hawaii National Guard, appropriate actions by the director of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and the Administrator of Emergency Management, and the expenditure of state general revenue funds for relief of conditions created by the fires. By August 9, the state government of Hawaii issued a state of emergency for the entirety of the state. On August 10, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a federal major disaster declaration.",
        "For the Lahaina fire alone, the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimated that over 2,200 buildings had been destroyed, overwhelmingly residential and including many historic landmarks in Lahaina. The damage caused by the fire has been estimated at nearly $6billion. In September 2023, the United States Department of Commerce published the official damage total of the wildfires as $5.5 billion (2023 USD).",
        "The typical area burned by wildfires in Hawaii has increased in recent decades, almost quadrupling. Experts have blamed the increase on the spread of nonnative vegetation and hotter, drier weather due to climate change.",
        "During the 2010s and early 2020s, Clay Trauernicht, a botanist and fire scientist at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, and several other experts warned that the decline of agriculture in Hawaii meant that large areas of formerly productive land had been left unmanaged; nonnative invasive species like guinea grass were spreading rapidly and increasing the risk of large wildfires. The state government failed to provide incentives or impose mandates to keep land clear of grass.  The state government also did not require all structure owners to maintain defensible space, a standard rule in fire-prone states like California. The shrinking of the agricultural workforce reduced overall firefighting capacity; those workers had traditionally suppressed fires on the land they cared for, and were so effective that sometimes the counties called them for help. In 2022, Trauernicht suggested that Hawaii follow  Europe's example by subsidizing agriculture as a public good as a form of fire risk reduction.  In 2023, UH Manoa biogeography professor Camilo Mora estimated the cost of land restoration to mitigate wildfire risk at about $1 billion.  Despite these calls to action, the Hawaii State Legislature had been unable to make much progress; a 2022 bill to spend just $1.5 million on additional fire risk reduction measures died in a legislative committee.",
        "Around the time the fires occurred, twenty percent of the county of Maui was experiencing moderate drought (level 1 of 4), and sixteen percent of the county was under severe drought conditions (level 2 of 4). A decrease in rainfall consistent with the predicted impacts of climate change had also been recorded in the Hawaiian Islands, according to the U.S. National Climate Assessment. In the decades leading up to the fire, overdevelopment practices led to further water management challenges that reduced the availability of water for firefighting and exacerbated drought conditions.",
        "In June 2014, the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, a nonprofit organization, prepared a Western Maui Community Wildfire Protection Plan which warned that most of the Lahaina area was at extremely high risk for burning.",
        "In Maui County's 2020 Hazard Mitigation Plan, the county identified Lahaina, the most heavily impacted community in the August fires, as lying within a high risk zone for wildfire.",
        "In its monthly seasonal outlook on August 1, 2023, the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) forecast \"above normal\" potential for significant wildland fires for Hawaii in August, concentrated on the islands' leeward sides. In addition to noting plentiful vegetation growth from the previous wet season and the expanding drought, the NIFC mentioned that \"tropical cyclones can also bring windy and dry conditions depending on how they approach the island chain and can exacerbate fire growth potential\".",
        "The vulnerability of the islands to deadly wildfires was gravely underestimated in long term assessments. A year prior, the State of Hawaii Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan Report had detailed wildfire risks as one of the lowest threats for the state. A 2021 Maui County assessment acknowledged the spike of wildfires in the state, but described funds as \"inadequate\" and heavily criticized the county fire department's strategic plan, claiming it said \"nothing about what can and should be done to prevent fires.\"",
        "In early August 2023, a high-pressure system remained north of the Hawaiian Islands. This formed strong surface pressure north of the islands, and also sustained stabilization across the region, creating warm and sunny conditions. Concurrently, Hurricane Dora began to intensify to Category 4 strength, which helped to create a large pressure difference between the high-pressure area and the low-pressure cyclone. This pressure difference aided in already significant trade winds moving southwest, and formed strong gradient winds over the islands. (A similar phenomenon occurred during the October 2017 Portugal wildfires during the passage of Hurricane Ophelia.) The exact significance of Hurricane Dora and how it impacted the fires themselves remains somewhat unclear. Meteorologists noted that the storm's center remained more than 700 miles (1,100km) from the islands and that it remained relatively small in size; however it also remained \"remarkably potent for a long time\", logging more hours as a Category 4 hurricane than any other storm in the Pacific for over 50 years. Philippe Papin, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, argued that Hurricane Dora played only a minor role in \"enhancing low-level flow over Maui at fire initiation time.\"",
        "By August 6, the National Weather Service identified a region of very dry air arriving from the East Pacific, greatly inhibiting the potential for rainfall. A prominent descending capping inversion forced even more stabilization of the atmosphere, which led to enhanced wind gusts and very dry conditions between August 7 and 8. As the day progressed, deep layer ridging combined with the existing pressure gradient created very strong wind gusts and caused humidity levels to be well below normal. The aforementioned cap was expected to only strengthen acceleration of wind due to terrain features near the islands.",
        "During the first few days of August, a multitude of minor brush fires affected the Hawaiian Islands. Multiple brush fires burned on the island of O\u02bbahu, stretching fire department resources, but were quickly contained by August 4. The island's south and west sides remained abnormally dry or in drought because of the fire, as well as weather conditions.",
        "At 5:00a.m. HST (UTC 15:00) on August 7, the National Weather Service's office in Honolulu issued a red flag warning for the leeward portions of all the islands until the morning of August 9, highlighting that \"very dry fuels combined with strong and gusty easterly winds and low humidities will produce critical fire weather conditions through Tuesday night\". East winds of 30\u201345 miles per hour (48\u201372km/h) with gusts over 60 miles per hour (97km/h) were forecast. In Maui County, officials reported gusts up to 80 miles per hour (130km/h) in the Upcountry Maui area.",
        "On August 4, 2023, at 11:01a.m. HST (UTC 21:01), the first of many small fires ignited on Maui. A 30-acre brush fire was reported adjacent to the Kahului Airport in a field. By 9:29p.m. HST (UTC 07:29), the fire was reported 90% contained, but many flights out of the airport were delayed to August 11.",
        "On August 8, 2023, intense winds knocked down numerous utility poles. By 4:55p.m. HST (UTC 02:55), \"about 30 downed poles\" had been reported on Maui, resulting in \"at least 15 separate outages impacting more than 12,400 customers\". By that time, there had been no power in some parts of West Maui since 4:50a.m. HST (UTC 14:50). Downed power lines are being investigated as a factor in igniting the fires, having been captured on video.",
        "The first significant fire of the event was reported at 12:22a.m. HST (UTC 10:30) on August 8 near Olinda Road in the community of Kula, in Upcountry Maui. Evacuations of nearby residents were announced beginning at 3:43a.m. (UTC 13:43). As of August 9, the fire had burned approximately 1,000 acres (400ha). Approximately 544 structures were exposed, 96% of which were residential, and 16 burned. Concurrent electrical grid sensor data and security camera footage reported by The Washington Post indicate that a downed power line, hit by a tree, may have caused this fire.",
        "The most significant fire of the complex of events began from a brush fire ignited in West Maui near the town of Lahaina on the morning of August 8. During the early morning hours of August 8, significant straight-line winds began to impact the town of Lahaina. Peak wind gusts that exceeded 80 miles per hour (130km/h) began to cause minor damage to homes and buildings in Lahaina, and subsequently, a power pole was snapped along Lahainaluna Road, across the street from the Lahaina Intermediate School near the northeast side of town.",
        "A three-acre (1.2ha) brush fire was reported at 6:37a.m. HST (UTC 16:37) as the downed power line sparked flames to dry grass near the road. Evacuations were ordered minutes later in the areas around Lahaina Intermediate School. Maui County Fire Department immediately responded, and by 9:00a.m HST (UTC 19:00), the fire was announced fully contained. Wind gusts continued to batter the town however, and by 3:30p.m. HST (UTC 01:30), the fire had flared up again, and forced the closure of Lahaina Bypass (Route 3000), with more evacuations nearby following. Residents on the west side of town received instructions to shelter in place.",
        "The wildfire rapidly grew in both size and intensity. Wind gusts pushed the flames through the northeastern region of the community, where dense neighborhoods were. Hundreds of homes burned in a matter of minutes, and residents identifying the danger attempted to flee in vehicles while surrounded by flames. As time progressed, the fire moved southwest and downslope towards the Pacific coast and Kahoma neighborhood. Firefighters were repeatedly stymied in their attempts to defend structures by failing water pressure in fire hydrants; as the melting pipes in burning homes leaked, the network lost pressure despite the presence of working backup generators.",
        "At 4:46p.m. HST (UTC 02:46), the fire reportedly crossed Honoapi\u02bbilani Highway (Hawaii Route 30) and entered the main part of Lahaina, forcing residents to self-evacuate with little or no notice. At this time, bumper-to-bumper traffic developed. By 5:45p.m. HST (UTC 03:45), the fire had reached the shoreline, when the United States Coast Guard first learned of people jumping into the ocean at Lahaina to escape the fire. Survivors later recalled getting trapped in a traffic jam and realizing they needed to go into the water when cars around them either caught fire or exploded.",
        "Officials said that civil defense sirens were not activated during the fire even though Hawaii has the world's largest integrated outdoor siren warning system, with over 80 sirens on Maui alone meant to be used in cases of natural disasters. Several residents later told journalists that they had received no warning and did not know what was happening until they encountered smoke or flames. There had been no power or communications in Lahaina for much of the day, and authorities issued a confusing series of social media alerts which reached a small audience.",
        "The death toll stood at 67 on August 11, but that number reflected only victims found outside buildings, because local authorities had waited for FEMA to send its specialized personnel to search building interiors. According to federal officials, many of the victims found outside \"were believed to have died in their vehicles\". The fire burned 2,170 acres (880ha) of land. PDC and FEMA estimated that 2,207 buildings had been destroyed, with a total of 2,719 exposed to the fires, and set the damage estimate at $5.52 billion as of August 11. The next day, Governor Josh Green announced the damage was close to $6 billion. Many historic structures were destroyed, including Waiola Church and Pioneer Inn. 86% of burned structures in L\u0101haina were residential.",
        "As of August 12, at least 93 people had been confirmed dead in and around Lahaina with only 3% of the area searched. The number of dead was expected to rise further as FEMA search-and-rescue specialists searched the interiors of burned-down buildings. Very few victims have been identified.",
        "By August 24, with 100% of the single-story, residential properties searched of the disaster area, 115 casualties had been confirmed with an additional 388 people missing. On September 7 officials reported that 99% of the area had been searched, with the death toll unchanged at 115 and the missing count reduced to 110. The disaster area remained restricted to authorized personnel due to unstable structures, exposed electrical wires, and potentially toxic ash and debris. The following day, the missing count was further reduced to 66 people. On September 15, the death toll was reduced from 115 to 97 as officials reported that DNA findings discovered that some of the remains came from the same victims. The number of missing persons was also reduced to 31 with only 1 addition to the list.",
        "On September 25 a small number of residents were allowed to enter North Lahaina for the first time in over 6 weeks. Officials planned to remove restrictions for all areas of the city over the next one to two months, pending cleanup efforts by the EPA.",
        "The Lahaina fire's death toll was the largest for a wildfire in the U.S. since the Cloquet fire of 1918, which killed 453 people.",
        "On the same night as the Kula and Lahaina fires, another major fire sparked near P\u016blehu Road, north of K\u012bhei. The fire quickly spread in the direction of the prevailing winds, and by early August 9, the large fire entered northeast portions of K\u012bhei, resulting in an evacuation order for multiple communities nearby. Within the following days, firefighters fully contained the fire and all residents were advised that it was safe to return.",
        "A small, single acre fire ignited on August 11, which led to the evacuation of K\u0101\u02bbanapali in West Maui before it was contained that same day. Another fire in K\u0101\u02bbanapali would ignite again on August 26 and have an evacuation order placed and lifted on the same day.",
        "In Hawai\u02bbi County, neighborhoods in the North and South Kohala districts of the Island of Hawai\u02bbi were evacuated due to rapidly spreading brush fires. On August 9, several other brush fires broke out near the communities of N\u0101'\u0101lehu and P\u0101hala; those fires were quickly brought under control. Hawai\u02bbi County Mayor Mitch Roth said there were no reports of injuries or destroyed homes on the Big Island.",
        "On August 16, a large brushfire sprung up on the outskirts of Wahiaw\u0101 on O\u02bbahu. Though it did not burn near any houses, the fire threatened local unhoused people as well as the K\u016bkaniloko Birth Site, a location registered under the National Register of Historic Places and near-thousand year old site that is the location of the births of Hawaiian chiefs.",
        "The governor of the state of Hawaii, Josh Green, referred to the Lahaina wildfires as the \"worst natural disaster\" in the history of Hawaii. It is the fifth deadliest wildfire in United States history, and the most lethal wildfire in the country since the Cloquet fire of 1918, which killed 453 people.",
        "As of January26, 2024, there were 100 confirmed deaths due to the Lahaina fire on Maui, all of whom have been identified. An additional 3 individuals remain unaccounted for as of January 26, 2024. Among the dead was confirmed to be a Filipino national who was a naturalized U.S. citizen. The death toll in West Maui made it the deadliest wildfire and natural disaster ever recorded in Hawaii since statehood.",
        "As of August 18, at least 67 people were injured in the fires. On August 9, at least twenty individuals were reported hospitalized at a Maui hospital. Six additional individuals, three of whom had critical burns, were reportedly transported by air ambulance from Maui to hospitals on O\u02bbahu.",
        "On August 17, 60 survivors were found alive sheltering inside a single home.",
        "Due to DNA testing determining that victims were unintentionally being counted multiple times, the death toll officially dropped from 115 to 97 on September 18.",
        "The main Maui wildfire burned much of the community of Lahaina, where more than 2,200 structures were damaged or destroyed, including much of the downtown Lahaina Historic District centered on Front Street. 96% of burned structures were residential. The 3.4-square-mile  area (8.8km) was the commercial, residential, and cultural center of the community. On August 17, Governor Green noted that the fire temperature had reached 1,000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C), since it was hot enough to melt granite counters and engine blocks.  Puddles of melted aluminum have been seen underneath burned-out vehicles.",
        "Although PDC and FEMA had initially estimated total damage at around $5.52 billion, catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. estimated on August 16 that insured property losses would be only $3.2 billion. Real estate experts expressed concern that many Lahaina homes were uninsured or underinsured and surviving owners might not have sufficient financial resources to build new homes in compliance with the state's current building code.  Many Native Hawaiians were able to afford to live in Lahaina only because they had inherited paid-off homes from previous generations, and since they had not needed mortgage loans to purchase their homes, they were not required to carry homeowners insurance coverage.",
        "The Lahaina Historic District, which was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1962 and was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii for 35 years, suffered extensive fire damage. Among the structures destroyed were:",
        "The fire also destroyed several cell towers in affected areas, causing service outages and 9-1-1 emergency telephone services to be rendered unavailable. The wildfire that burned near the community of Kula, located in Maui's Upcountry, destroyed at least two homes.",
        "The Maria Lanakila Catholic Church in Lahaina, which had been dedicated in 1858. Contrary to early reports, the main church building and steeple were not destroyed and survived the fire largely intact, though the roof and interior may have sustained some damage.",
        "The Lahaina Civic Center, venue for the Maui Invitational Tournament, a prominent early-season college men's basketball event, has so far escaped significant damage, although it had to be evacuated after earlier serving as an evacuation center. The 2023 tournament, scheduled for November, was moved to Honolulu at the Stan Sheriff Center instead.",
        "Lahaina's famous banyan tree, the largest banyan tree in the United States, had most of its foliage charred, though was left standing after the fire. A video taken on August 11 showed local officials watering the tree to aid its recovery. At least some green foliage appeared to be present and the roots, trunks, and branches of the tree were largely undamaged.",
        "On August 11, unsafe water alerts were issued as early as 3 p.m. (01:00 UTC) warning residents of Lahaina and Upper Kula, with instructions to not drink or use tap water for daily activities, even after boiling, and all residents were requested to limit water use. Following earlier deployments on August 9, further potable water tankers were set up at locations across the island. Some scientists have also warned that charred soils, toxic contaminated top soil and other debris could run off into the shoreline and cause marine habitats and coral to be damaged.",
        "The fires prompted mass evacuations of thousands of residents and visitors from L\u0101haina, K\u0101\u02bbanapali, K\u012bhei, and Kula. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that they had rescued 17 people who had jumped into the sea in Lahaina to escape the fires. As of August 12, more than 1,400 people on Maui remained in shelters. Vacationing San Francisco mayor London Breed was among those evacuated from Maui.",
        "An estimated 11,000 people flew out of Maui via Kahului Airport on August 9, 2023.",
        "American, Southwest, Hawaiian, and Alaska Airlines had added additional flights to their routes into Kahului Airport by August 10 to help evacuate people from the island, and American replaced a narrow-body Airbus A321 with a wide-body Boeing 777 to further boost capacity. All four airlines had also reportedly waived fare cancellation penalties and fare-difference fees for affected passengers, and Hawaiian and Southwest offered temporary $19 interisland flights until August 11.  By August 13, 2023, over 46,000 visitors had flown out of Maui via Kahului Airport.",
        "Hawaiian state officials created plans to house visitors along with thousands of displaced Maui residents at the Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu, O\u02bbahu and over 100 had stayed as of August 10.",
        "After the fire swept through Lahaina on August 8, Maui County blocked public access to all of West Maui with checkpoints on Route 30/340 (Honoapi\u02bbilani Highway, the only highway in and out of the area). Over the next three days, the blockade created a desperate situation for residents of still-intact communities who ran low on medicine, food, and fuel, while other residents and tourists who suddenly found themselves outside of the blockade wished to retrieve their belongings. On August 11, 2023, the County reopened the checkpoint on Route 30 at M\u0101\u02bbalaea to help ameliorate these issues. Within five hours, the checkpoint was closed again, reportedly because of attempts to enter the sealed-off portion of Lahaina.",
        "On September 25 officials cleared a small area in North Lahaina for reentry, the first time in over 6 weeks that residents had been allowed back into the city. Visiting residents were provided with personal protective equipment and urged not to disturb the ash, which may contain hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead.",
        "The Maui Humane Society stated that there is an estimated 3,000 animals from Lahaina that were currently missing after the fires as of August 16. As of August 14, the society had received about 367 lost animal reports and some dual reported with the society and on the \"Missing Pets of Maui\" Facebook page created by the society which has about 6,400 members. Any found animals are checked for any identification and scanned for a microchip, with the society urging that found deceased animals should not be moved or destroyed so that they can be cataloged and checked for any identification.",
        "Animal welfare advocates and the Maui Police were working in tandem to search the burned areas for lost, injured or deceased animals, with dozens of feeding and drinking stations set up to draw out animals. After the fire in order to make room for animals that were impacted by the fires, the Humane Society, and the only open-admission animal shelter on the island airlifted over 100 shelter animals to Portland, Oregon. Veterinarians and staff members of the K\u012bhei Veterinary Clinic, the Humane Society, and the Central Maui Animal Clinic and volunteers coordinated care for the found animals as well as disbursing free medical care, food and animal medication to island residents. Donations and care were also extended to the Maui Police Department's K-9 unit that are working with recovery efforts and housing for the animals.",
        "Scientists with the National Science Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began to prep for studies that would monitor and document any changes in water quality due to soil erosion and other effects of the fire that can affect the island's waterways and ecosystems. Others expressed thanks that areas such as the Maui Bird Conservation Center was spared from the majority of the fires, as it housed a large portion of the alal\u0101 flock.",
        "Within two weeks of the Maui wildfires, lawyers from California, Florida, Oregon, Texas, and Washington had come to Maui to sign up wildfire victims as plaintiffs. Chief Disciplinary Counsel Bradley Tamm (the state's primary lawyer regulator) warned Hawaiians to be careful: \"It\u2019s a feeding frenzy. There are sharks both in the water and on the land\". Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc., the primary electric utility for Maui, became a significant focus of such litigation. By August 14, at least one lawsuit had been filed against Hawaiian Electric, and the company experienced a decline in its stock value.",
        "On August 9, 2023, a deputy attorney general representing the Board of Land and Natural Resources filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to the Hawai'i Supreme Court, alleging that a Hawaii circuit court judge's rulings regarding private water usage had restricted the amount of water available to fight the fires. This claim was disputed by the responding Sierra Club, who requested the Supreme Court to sanction the Attorney General for filing the petition under false pretenses. The attorney representing Maui County stated during the hearing that a lack of water was never an issue during the wildfires. The Supreme Court denied the petition.",
        "On October 4, 2023,  a filing with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission showed that Hawaiian Electric was underinsured against its potential liability exposure for the Maui wildfires, with only about $165 million in liability insurance coverage. According to ALM's Law.com, as of October 5, 2023, more than 35 lawsuits had been filed against Hawaiian Electric and other defendants. Most but not all had been filed in Hawaii state circuit courts, especially the Second Circuit based in Wailuku (which has jurisdiction over Maui County).  In response, Hawaiian Electric retained California law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson as its lead defense counsel. The same law firm had previously worked for Pacific Gas and Electric on litigation arising out of the 2018 California wildfires, in which its attorneys had billed their time in 2019 at rates between $400 and $1,400 per hour.",
        "U.S. President Joe Biden ordered the mobilization of \"all available federal assets\" to help respond to the wildfires. In a statement, Biden noted that the United States Navy Third Fleet and the United States Coast Guard were supporting \"response and rescue efforts\". The United States Department of Transportation was working with commercial airlines to help evacuate tourists from Maui. To help with the ongoing Coast Guard search and rescue operation, the United States Navy sent in Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron Three Seven (HSM-37) and two MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, with the United States Indo-Pacific Command standing ready to provide additional assistance as needed. Meanwhile, the U.S. 25th Infantry Division from Schofield Barracks on O\u02bbahu was deployed alongside the Hawaii National Guard to Maui and Hawaii Island to assist with fire suppression support, search and rescue operations, and traffic control.",
        "President Biden approved the state of Hawaii's request for a major disaster declaration on August 10, making federal funding available for recovery efforts in the affected areas. On August 10, FEMA initiated deployment of Urban Search and Rescue Task Force personnel from around the United States to Maui. Washington State Task Force 1 sent 45 specialists along with a 5-member K-9 team. Each human member of the K-9 team works with a canine partner, a FEMA-certified human remains detection dog. The same task force had previously deployed to Maui in 2018 to assist with the aftermath of Hurricane Lane. On August 10, Nevada Task Force 1 was initially asked to send one K-9 handler and dog, who left that same day. The request was amended to four more specialists, then on top of that, a full 45-member task force team, all of whom flew out on August 11.",
        "FEMA initially provided $700 payments as one of several types of federal assistance available to survivors of the wildfire, which was meant to address immediate needs such as food, water, and clothing.",
        "California sent 11 members of Urban Search and Rescue task forces based in the cities of Sacramento, Riverside, and Oakland, and six employees of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. On August 15, California announced that it was increasing its deployment to 101 people, including an incident management team of 67 Cal Fire employees.  Among the new personnel arriving on Maui were forensic anthropologists from Chico State who had helped identify victims of the Camp Fire (2018).",
        "By August 16, the number of FEMA cadaver dogs deployed to the scene had increased to 40, and Governor Green explained that the searchers were in a \"race against time\" to recover remains before they could be degraded by the next rainstorm.  Each dog could only work for about 15 to 20 minutes in the tropical heat before rotating into an air-conditioned truck to cool down. The dogs also had to wear booties to shield their paws from asphalt temperatures exceeding 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) and still-hot embers, but the booties themselves required frequent replacement.",
        "Meanwhile, on August 15, a federal Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT) arrived on the island to assist with the identification and processing of the large number of remains. The DMORT brought along a portable morgue in the form of 22.5 short tons (20,400kg) of equipment and supplies, and nine Matson shipping containers were seen outside the Maui Police Department's Forensic Facility in Wailuku.",
        "On August 17, a five-member National Response Team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrived on Maui to investigate the cause and origin of the Lahaina fire.  The team included an electrical engineer from the Fire Research Laboratory.",
        "On August 21, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden arrived at Kahului Airport, where they met with Governor Josh Green, his wife Jaime, as well as members of Hawaii's congressional delegation. The Bidens then boarded Marine One where they were given an aerial tour of the devastation.  Biden then went to Lahaina where he met with first responders as well as local and state officials and FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. The Bidens walked through the ruins of the town seeing the area firsthand. They also took part in a blessing by island elders. Biden then spoke to the community and met with survivors at the Lahaina Civic Center.",
        "By August 25, the FEMA Urban Search and Rescue task forces had searched 99% of the disaster area, and they wrapped up their work and returned home to the mainland United States.",
        "Hawaii Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke, who was serving as acting governor in the absence of Governor Josh Green while he was traveling outside of Hawaii, issued an emergency proclamation and activated the Hawaii National Guard. The Hawaii National Guard, together with the U.S. 25th Infantry Division from Schofield Barracks on O\u02bbahu, deployed to Maui and Hawaii Island to assist with fire suppression support, search and rescue operations, and traffic control. Two UH-60 Blackhawk and one CH-47 Chinook helicopters were also deployed to support fire suppression efforts.",
        "As of August9, 2023, the Hawaii Tourism Authority was asking all visitors on Maui for non-essential travel to leave the island and strongly discouraged any further non-essential travel to the island.",

        "The Hawaiian Mission Houses Archives has uploaded items to their digitization project relevant to Lahaina's history such as photos, journals, drawings, and letters to aid in the recovery of historic sites.",
        "A lack of adequate warning and preparation has also come into focus. Despite Hawaii's advanced integrated outdoor siren warning system, on Maui, 80 of these sirens, designed for tsunamis and other disasters, remained silent as the fires burned. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency attributed the lack of activation to the fires' rapid progression and existing ground response coordination. And while residents received other alerts, such as mobile phone notifications, the intensity and urgency of these messages were deemed insufficient. At least one analyst compared them unfavorably to high-priority tsunami warnings, suggesting a possible alarm fatigue among residents, where frequent, less urgent alerts can diminish the perceived significance of real threats. The administrator of the Maui County Emergency Management Agency, Herman Andaya, defended the decision not to activate the emergency sirens in an August 16 press conference; he argued that the outdoor sirens exist only on the coastline and are normally used to warn residents to flee tsunamis by heading to the mountainside, which would have sent them straight into the fire. Andaya resigned the next day effective immediately, citing health reasons.",
        "The Lahaina wildfires also exposed gaps in the state's wildfire preparedness. In a 2021 report, Hawaii officials ranked wildfire risk as \"low\" despite increasing fire acreage and dangers from drought and non-native grasses. The report criticized inadequate funding and lack of fire prevention strategies. Previous wildfires served as a warning, but risks were not adequately addressed. Hawaii's fire management budgets had not kept pace with growing threats, according to the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization. Non-native, flammable grasses remained widespread, increasing fire risk. The climatologist Abby Frazier emphasized Hawaii's extreme wildfire vulnerability and called for more serious fire prevention efforts. The 2021 Maui County report had recommended fire hazard risk assessment and replacing non-native grasses, but it is unclear if these recommendations were implemented.",
        "A state official for the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources delayed the request of the release of water by the West Maui Land Co. to protect its holdings until it was too late. In early September, it was reported that residents of numerous communities around the state of Hawaii had become deeply worried about the risk of losing their own homes to wildfires, after seeing how Lahaina had been so suddenly destroyed.",
        "Following the fires, a variety of conspiracy theories about them were posted to social media, notably by far-right conspiracy theorist Stew Peters. Some contained doctored images or images and videos of other unrelated events presented as being from the fires, often ostensibly demonstrating that a directed-energy weapon or \"space laser\" was involved. There have also been mentions of famous individuals' estates in Hawaii that have not been damaged from the fires, prompting unsubstantiated accusations of blame. Other posts have claimed that wildfires do not occur naturally or that vegetation is not left standing in a natural fire. Real Raw News, a fake news website, promoted falsehoods about U.S. Marines attacking a FEMA convoy fleeing the wildfires and arresting FEMA deputy administrator Erik Hooks.",
        "Researchers from Microsoft, Recorded Future, the RAND Corporation, NewsGuard and the University of Maryland found that a Chinese government-directed disinformation campaign used the disaster to attempt to sow discord in the US. Lahaina residents were discouraged from going to the agencies for assistance by disinformation from people who regularly spread Russian propaganda."

    "Hurricane Hilary": [
        "Hurricane Hilary was a large and powerful Pacific hurricane in August 2023 that brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to the Pacific Coast of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula, and the Southwestern United States, resulting in widespread flooding and mudslides. The cyclone was the eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season. Hilary originated from a tropical wave south of Mexico on August16, and strengthened into a hurricane a day later while paralleling the southwest coast of Mexico. The hurricane underwent rapid intensification, reaching maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a central pressure of 940mbar (27.76inHg) on August18, making it a Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. After environmental conditions became unfavorable, Hilary weakened as it approached land, making landfall as a tropical storm in San Quint\u00edn along the western Baja California peninsula, becoming post-tropical before being absorbed into a new system shortly after.",
        "In anticipation of \"catastrophic and life-threatening flooding\", the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, extending from the Mexico\u2013United States border to just north of Los Angeles. Persistent heavy rainfall, potentially \"more than a year\u2019s worth of rain\" in some areas, was forecasted. Due to this, flood watches were issued, affecting about 26million people across four states (Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah), and the entire region was placed under a high risk threat for flash flooding by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).",
        "In Mexico, the hurricane killed two people due to floodwaters, and left 250million pesos (US$14.7million) in damage. The storm left behind flooded roads, mudslides and downed trees in the Baja California peninsula and in Southern California. Some areas of the latter region received up to 600% of their annual rainfall averages for the month of August. The floods killed one person in San Bernardino County, California. Damage in the United States were estimated at US$900million, much of it in Inyo County, California, where most of the roads in Death Valley National Park were damaged by floods. Even so, its overall impact on the region was less severe than initially feared. Hilary broke records in four U.S. states for wettest tropical cyclone or its remnants.",
        "The origins of Hilary was from a tropical wave that exited the western coast of Africa around August3. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Lesser Antilles by August9. On that day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first identified the potential for the eventual development, 156hours before Hilary's formation. The tropical wave crossed Central America into the far eastern Pacific Ocean on August12, producing a large area of disorganized convection, or thunderstorms. As early as August13, hurricane prediction models anticipated a tropical cyclone would affect Mexico and the southwestern United States. A low pressure area developed on August14 south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, as the thunderstorms gradually organized. After a low-level circulation formed early on August16, the system developed into a tropical depression by 06:00UTC, located about 345mi (555km) south of Acapulco. Six hours later, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and the NHC named it Hilary.",
        "Upon its formation, Hilary was moving northwestward, steered by a ridge over Mexico. Atmospheric and environmental conditions were conducive for further strengthening, including warm sea surface temperatures of near 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), ample moisture, and low wind shear. Accordingly, the NHC warned that Hilary had a high likelihood of rapid intensification. Convection around the storm increased and organized into a central dense overcast, with an eye developing in the center. On August17, Hilary intensified into a hurricane, by which time it had expanded into a large tropical cyclone, with tropical storm-force winds extending 230mi (370km) from the center. Symmetric outflow and pronounced rainbands developed around the hurricane. Early on August18, Hilary intensified into a major hurricane, or a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The convection around the center organized into a thick ring around the eye. At 06:00UTC that day, the NHC estimated that Hilary attained a peak intensity of 140mph (220km/h), making it a Category4, while its barometric pressure dropped to 940mbar (28inHg). The intensity estimate was based on satellite imagery using the Dvorak technique. By the time of its peak, Hilary commenced a 48hour period of intensification following its development.",
        "After reaching its peak intensity, Hilary weakened slightly due to an eyewall replacement cycle, in which the inner eye collapsed as the larger, outer eyewall contracted. The Hurricane Hunters first investigated the storm late on August18, by which time Hilary fell to Category3 intensity. Around that time, the hurricane began moving more to the northwest, reaching the western periphery of the ridge over Mexico. Another Hurricane Hunters flight on August19 observed that Hilary re-intensified into a Category4 hurricane, with a secondary peak of 130mph (215km/h), and a pressure of 943mbar (27.8inHg). Thereafter, drier and stable air began affecting the hurricane, along with cooler water temperatures, causing the eye to fall apart. Hilary quickly weakened as it accelerated north-northward, responding to the steering influences of a trough of low pressure near the California coast and a ridge of high pressure over the central United States. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on August20, as wind shear from the trough displaced the thunderstorms far north of the center. At around 17:00UTC that day, Hilary made landfall in a sparsely-populated region of northwestern Mexico in the state of Baja California, with sustained winds estimated at 60mph (95km/h). This was about 215mi (345km) south-southeast of San Diego, California.",
        "After moving ashore, Hilary's circulation became elongated and disrupted over the mountainous terrain of Baja California. Devoid of convection, Hilary degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone, and soon after was absorbed by a low pressure area developing near the southern coast of California, outside of outside of Hilary's wind radius. The NHC tracked the two systems as the same, assessing that Hilary continued into southern California as a tropical storm, which would have had made it the first tropical storm to cross into the state since Nora in 1997. The remnants of Hilary continued moving through the western United States, eventually crossing into Canada. In February 2024, former chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ryan Maue, stated that Hurricane Hilary was \u201can unprecedented \"climate change-fueled disaster\" juiced up by El Ni\u00f1o\u201d.",
        "The Mexican government issued watches for southern Baja California Sur on August17. They were upgraded to warnings later that day. Hurricane watches were issued for western parts of the Baja California peninsula at 03:00 UTC on August 18, and by 15:00 UTC the same day, they were upgraded to hurricane warnings as hurricane watches were issued for the west coast of Baja California.",
        "Nearly 1,900people in Mexico evacuated to shelters along the Baja California peninsula. This included about 850people evacuated by the Mexican Navy from five offshore islands. Several schools in Cabo San Lucas were used as temporary shelters, and 18,000soldiers were on alert. Officials closed ports from Oaxaca to Colima on August17, and later extended closures to Baja California Sur. School classes and public activities were cancelled in Baja California, with a baseball game postponed. Around 20 flights were cancelled at Los Cabos International Airport. Beaches were closed in La Paz, Tijuana, and Ensenada.",
        "On August15, five days before Hilary's landfall and a day before the system was named, local National Weather Service (NWS) offices in California first released videos and briefings related to the potential impacts. The first issued a flood watch on August17 for the mountain and desert regions of southern California. A day later, the NHC issued its first-ever tropical storm watch for Southern California, later upgraded to a tropical storm warning. The Weather Prediction Center (WPC) also issued a level 4/high risk for excessive rainfall, which was the first ever high risk of flash flooding in the desert valleys of Southern California east of the Peninsular Ranges. The NWS issued a flood watch for portions of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, affecting about 26million people. WPC forecaster David Roth described the rainfall potential as \"exceedingly rare, bordering on unique, for the region from a tropical cyclone and unique for Nevada, which had its first ever High Risk WPC Day issued for the state\". Roth expected a broad area would experience 1-in-100year rainfall totals. The NWS also issued flash flood warnings for San Bernardino and Kern counties.",
        "On August20, the Storm Prediction Center issued a level 2/slight risk in Southern California, which included 5% risk of tornadoes. That night, a tornado warning was issued for Alpine and Descanso in San Diego County. The WPC later forecast the chance for 5 inches (130mm) of rainfall in the mountains of Idaho from the system. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) staff and personnel were ordered to be positioned in southern California by President Joe Biden, and Biden urged residents and people in the storm's path to take precautions. An emergency operations center was opened in San Diego and Los Angeles.",
        "California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for southern California. Local states of emergency were declared in Los Angeles, Palm Springs, and in Indio. The California National Guard preemptively deployed to multiple locations across southern California on August19. The American Red Cross opened shelters in Imperial, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties. Emergency shelters were also opened by local governments in Yucca Valley and Twentynine Palms. Nevada governor Joe Lombardo deployed 100 National Guard and Nevada National Guard troops to assist southern Nevada impacted by severe weather associated with Hilary. Lombardo also declared a state of emergency, along with emergencies in Clark and Nye counties. The United States Navy moved carriers and ships out to sea and out of Hilary's path, including the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and to park aircraft in hangars. The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation announced that all parks and facilities were closed for two days. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department advised all people to leave Catalina Island on August 19, while Avalon Bay was closed to boats and ships. Additional resources were deployed to the island by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Los Angeles County Fire Department. On August19, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department issued evacuation warnings for Oak Glen, Forest Falls, Mountain Home Village, Angelus Oaks and northeast Yucaipa. Officials issued a voluntary evacuation order for residents around the Salton Sea, due to the potential for flooding. Evacuation warnings were also issued for Orange County, including areas near the Bond Fire scar. Parts of Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead were closed.",

They also truncated the August 19 runs of westbound Southwest Chief and the southbound Coast Starlight to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Emeryville, California, respectively. The August 20 runs of these two trains going eastbound and westbound respectively would also originate from these locations. Numerous Pacific Surfliner trains were also cancelled, forced to run on modified schedules, or delayed between August 19\u201321 as well. The launch for Falcon 9 and Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base near Los Angeles was postponed by SpaceX. Numerous airlines offered travel waivers to airports in southern California, after at least 1,000 flights were cancelled and 3,700 were delayed across the region. Affected airports included Palm Springs, Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Burbank, Long Beach, Ontario, Orange County, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and San Diego.",
        "Major League Baseball rescheduled three games in advance of Hilary: one each for the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Los Angeles Angels. Major League Soccer home games for the LA Galaxy and Los Angeles FC were also rescheduled. Del Mar Racetrack canceled the race meeting scheduled on August20. This is only the second time in the 84-year track's history that such a cancellation occurred. In addition, no live audience was permitted to attend the August20 games for VALORANT Champions Los Angeles at the Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall. Ongoing strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA were cancelled for Monday in Los Angeles in preparation for Hilary.

DoorDash temporarily suspended operations in numerous areas across southern California.",
        "From its genesis to its dissipation, Hilary's outer rainbands affected much of western Mexico as far southeast as Oaxaca. Offshore western Mexico, Hurricane Hilary passed west Socorro Island near the time of its peak intensity, producing wind gusts of 79mph (128mph). Along the Baja California peninsula, Hilary produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds. The heaviest rainfall was 12.83inches (326mm), recorded in San Lucas Norte in northeastern Baja California Sur, which was 180% of the average annual rainfall for the state. High rains caused flooding and landslides across the peninsula. Rainfall spread across the peninsula and into the adjacent states of Sonora and Sinaloa. The highest wind gust in Mexico was recorded by a high-altitude anemometer in Sierra de la Laguna, which recorded wind gusts of 99mph (159km/h) at an elevation of 6,395ft (1,949m). Closer to sea level, wind gusts reached 69mph (111km/h) at Loreto International Airport along the peninsula's eastern coast. Tropical storm-force winds extended into the state of Sonora, where Mar de Cort\u00e9s International Airport recorded gusts of 66mph (105km/h).",

        "On August 28, the government of Baja California Sur calculated the damage statewide to be 250million pesos (US$14.7million).",
        "Torrential rainfall caused widespread flooding and landslides in Baja California Sur. One man died in Santa Rosal\u00eda, when his vehicle was washed away by floodwaters. Officials in Baja California reported numerous mud and rock slides across the state along with several power outages.",
        "The remnants of Hilary moved through the western United States, producing rainfall from California as far north as Montana. The maximum recorded precipitation of 13.07in (332mm) at Upper Mission Creek in southeastern California. Damage nationwide was estimated at US$900million.",
        "The system's push toward Southern California coincided with a 5.1magnitude earthquake that struck north of Los Angeles near Ojai, California, along with numerous aftershocks. Only minor damage and no injuries were reported from the quakes. As a result, the term \"hurriquake\" trended on social media.",
        "While Hilary approached and dissipated near Southern California, the storm produced locally high winds along with heavy rainfall, with some desert locations receiving more than half of their annual rainfall in a single day. The strongest gusts were recorded in Los Angeles County\u2013 87mph (140km/h) at Magic Mountain, and San Diego County\u2013 84mph (135km/h) at Big Black Mountain. High winds knocked down at least 50power poles in the town of Thermal. The highest rain totals were recorded in the San Bernardino Mountains\u2013 11.73in (298mm) at Raywood Flats, and the San Jacinto Mountains\u2013 11.74in (298mm) at Mount San Jacinto. Floodwaters in the community of Angelus Oaks swept away a mobile home, killing a woman. The remnants of Hilary set rainfall records across the state. Rainfall at Furnace Creek in Death Valley totaled 2.20in (56mm), setting a new single-day rainfall record; the amount was more than the annual average rainfall of 2.15in (55mm). On August20, downtown Los Angeles and San Diego each recorded its wettest single summer day on record (June through August) with 2.48in (63mm) and 1.82in (46mm) of precipitation, respectively. Palm Springs recorded 3.18in (81mm), also a single summer day record amount, or 69% of its average annual rainfall.",
        "The collective impacts of downed trees and floods damaged or washed away roads in 13counties across California, from San Diego and Imperial counties along the state's southern border with Mexico to Siskiyou County in far northern California. The California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) estimated the cost to repair roads at over $146million. Portions of I-8, I-10, I-15, the Pacific Coast Highway, and other roads closed due to floods and rockslides. Closed state roads included portions of routes 14, 38, 58, 127, 136, 178, and 190. All roads in Death Valley National Park were severely damaged by flash flooding, with damage estimated at $500million in Inyo County alone, forcing the park to close for two months. Flash floods also damaged roads and trails in Mojave National Preserve. Farther north, heavy rain produced mudslides and flash flooding in Siskiyou County near Mount Shasta, damaging roads and rains.",
        "Damage in Riverside County totaled $126million, including about $83million in damaged roads and bridges, and about $26million affecting water systems. That made it the costliest natural disaster in the history of the county, with much of it occurring in the Coachella Valley. Across the valley, 9-1-1 phone service was down for a few days, which required residents to either text or call alternate numbers for emergencies. A nearly 30mi (48km) stretch of Interstate 10 (I-10) closed for two days from the floods, mud, and debris, which stranded hundreds of vehicles, and made it difficult to travel to Palm Springs. At least six state highways in Riverside County were closed due to floods, debris flow, or rockslides. Floods washed out a bridge over the Mias Canyon, isolating residents in Oak Glen. Along the Whitewater River, floodwaters 15ft (4.6m) deep damaged a bridge, derailed eight train cars, and buried another train in mud. In Palm Desert, floodwaters displaced at least 30residents in the Spanish Walk neighborhood. Also in Palm Desert, high winds knocked down a large tree, blocking a portion of SR 111. In Cathedral City, floodwaters entered a nursing home, requiring 14people to be rescued by loaders. At least 10people in Thermal evacuated to shelters. Floodwaters entered Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, but this did not impact operations there. In Palm Springs, the floods inundated vehicles, while downed power lines sparked a few small fires.",
        "In San Diego, the heavy rainfall caused the San Diego River to quickly rise to a crest of 9.6ft (2.9m). City firefighters rescued a group of 13people from a flooded homeless camp along the river, while the Harbor Police rescued two people from a boat washed against Harbor Island. Floodwaters washed out a portion of SR 78 at Yaqui Pass. High winds overturned a semi-trailer truck near Borrego Springs. In La Habra in Orange County, the winds damaged housing shingles. About 41,000customers were left without electricity across the Los Angeles area. Also in the city, a mudslide damaged the Marlton School. Across the Imperial Valley, high winds downed trees and power poles, as well as damaging a gas station canopy in El Centro. Damage in Imperial County reached $9.3million. In Barstow, a lightning strike knocked down a power pole onto I-15, closing the highway. The storm spawned a microburst in Fresno, producing winds of 55mph (89km/h), which knocked down 50trees at the Belmont Country Club. Winds also knocked down a power pole and electric lines in the city.",
        "Locally heavy rainfall spread across much of the western United States from the remnants of Hilary. Arizona received much less precipitation from Hilary than forecasted, only peaking at (2.10in (53mm) in Hilltop. However, records for wettest (total rainfall) tropical cyclones and their remnants were broken in four states: Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon. The strongest winds beyond California primarily occurred in Nevada and Utah at high-elevation locations above 9,000ft (2,700m). In a mountainous area near Mount Charleston, in Clark County, Nevada, wind gusts reached 82mph (132km/h), strong enough to knock down a few trees. The weather station at Cardiff Pass in Utah recorded a gust of 75mph (121km/h). Thunderstorms produced high winds near Weiser, Idaho, reaching 69mph (111km/h), strong enough to knock down a few trees.",
        "The new mark in Nevada was more than double the previous record, with 9.20in (234mm) recorded in Lee Canyon. Across Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and nearby mountainous areas, the rains produced flash flooding, which washed away roads, underground pipes, a fire station, and trails. The damage, estimated at $25million, closed the recreation area until October26, when Nevada State Route 156 (Lee Canyon Road) was reopened. The community of Mount Charleston had to shelter in place after electricity and road access were cut off. The town's fire department was inundated with mud, with houses and a nearby school damaged. A landslide also damaged part of Lee Canyon Ski and Snowboard Resort. Floods closed a portion of U.S. Route 95 in Nevada in Nye County. The rains rose the water levels in Lake Mead by 0.16in (4.1mm). In eastern Washington, rain from the system was beneficial with helping extinguish the 2023 Washington wildfires.",
        "Due to storm damage, Riverside County announced in September 2023 the availability of tax relief for property owners incurring more than $10,000 in damage, while also opening an office in Yucaipa to provide assistance to the public. On October3, the United States Small Business Administration opened a Disaster Loan Outreach Center in Angelus Oaks, to provide loans to homes and businesses affected by the storm. On October5, the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration announced the release of $15.3million in emergency funds to help rebuild roads and bridges in 12California counties. On November22, U.S. President Joe Biden announced a major disaster declaration for five California counties affected by the storm: Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Riverside and Siskiyou. The announcement provided federal funding for emergency work toward repairing or replacing damaged public facilities. On December14, the Palm Desert city council authorized a $4.63million contract to expand a water retention basin by about 36%, near where I-10 was flooded. The project was intended to withstand the 100year flood. Following heavy rainfall in Death Valley, floodwaters reformed the ancient Lake Manly in what the usually dry Badwater Basin, lasting several months. In the Mount Charleston region of Nevada, workers spent $11million to reopen roads to the mountainous communities. At the Lee Canyon Ski Resort, workers used dump trucks to restore damaged ski slopes, reopening the resort on November4."

    "2023 Johannesburg building fire": [
        "On 31 August 2023 at around 01:30 SAST, a fire engulfed an illegally occupied government-owned building in Johannesburg, South Africa; 77 people were killed and 88 others were injured. It was one of the deadliest fires in South African history.",
        "The building, 80 Albert Street, was built in 1954 as the head office of Johannesburg's Non-European Affairs Department, serving as a Pass Office for enforcing pass laws controlling the movement of black people into Johannesburg under the apartheid system. From 1994, the building housed a women's shelter later called the Usindiso Women's Shelter. In 2019, a clinic housed in the building was relocated by the member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Health and Social Development, Mpho Phalatse, as the building was occupied by squatters and found to be unsafe.",
        "The building is marked with a heritage plaque narrating its history.",
        "The fire broke out in the early hours of the morning on 31 August 2023, in the Central Business District, at a five-storey abandoned building on the corner of Delvers and Albert Streets that is owned by the city government and was taken over by gangs. It was being illegally occupied by as many as 400 impoverished people\u2014many of them foreign nationals, economic migrants, and asylum seekers\u2014all of whom were being charged rent by the gangs. The cause of the fire is not currently known. It spread through the building, trapping many people due to flimsy partitions and gates between makeshift rooms constructed by residents.",
        "Many residents jumped from the windows of the building to escape, some of whom did not survive the jump. Firefighters found bodies piled up where they had died at a locked gate on the ground floor while trying to exit the burning building.",
        "The fire brought attention to the hundreds of hijacked buildings in the Johannesburg CBD, typically overcrowded and unregulated and inhabited by impoverished and marginalised people including a large number of undocumented migrants to South Africa's economic hub of Johannesburg.",
        "Some residents who survived the fire refused to board buses for relocation to emergency accommodation in community halls after the fire, fearing the relocation would be used by officials as an excuse for deportation, and being unwilling to leave behind the remains of their possessions in the burnt building.",
        "In January 2024, a 29-year-old man was arrested after he confessed to starting the fire. The man said he started the fire in order to get rid of another murder victim's body on the orders of a Tanzanian drug dealer who also lived in the building. He is currently facing 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder.",
        "President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the site of the tragedy on 31 August, calling it a \"wake-up call\". Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi announced an inquiry into the fire. While government officials blamed the crisis on NGOs, who prevented the previous attempts to evict occupiers from similar properties, NGOs and inner city property owners argued that it was the duty of the City of Johannesburg to maintain buildings, provide services and enforce safety regulations. South Africa's courts have consistently ruled that evictions cannot proceed unless alternative housing is provided under the provisions of the 1998 Prevention of Illegal Eviction Act. Following the fire, the City attempted to disconnect illegal electricity connections from similar hijacked buildings in the city, but was met with strong resistance from residents."

    "2023 Al Haouz earthquake": [
        "On 8 September 2023 at 23:11 DST (22:11 UTC), an earthquake with a moment magnitude of 6.9 and maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent) struck Morocco's Al Haouz Province. The earthquake's epicenter was 73.4km (45.6mi) southwest of Marrakesh, near the town of Ighil and the Ouka\u00efmeden ski resort in the Atlas Mountains. It occurred as a result of shallow oblique-thrust faulting beneath the mountain range. At least 2,960 deaths were reported, with most occurring outside Marrakesh. Damage was widespread, and historic landmarks in Marrakesh were destroyed. The earthquake was also felt in Spain, Portugal, and Algeria.",
        "It is the strongest instrumentally recorded earthquake in Morocco, the deadliest in the country since the 1960 Agadir earthquake, and the second-deadliest earthquake of 2023 after the Turkey\u2013Syria earthquakes. Its magnitude also makes it the largest earthquake on the African continent since the 2006 Mw\u202f 7.0 Mozambique earthquake and the largest in North Africa since the 1980 Mw\u202f 7.1 El Asnam earthquake. Over 2.8 million people from Marrakesh and areas surrounding the Atlas Mountains were affected, including 100,000 children. Following the earthquake, many countries offered humanitarian assistance, and Morocco announced a three-day period of national mourning.",
        "Morocco lies close to the Azores\u2013Gibraltar Transform Fault, which is the boundary between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This zone of right-lateral strike-slip becomes transpressional at its eastern end, with the development of large thrust faults. To the east of the Strait of Gibraltar, in the Alboran Sea, the boundary becomes collisional in type. Most of the seismicity in Morocco is related to movement on that plate boundary, with the greatest seismic hazard in the north of the country close to the boundary. In 2004, Al Hoceima was struck by a magnitude 6.3 earthquake that killed 628 people and left 926 injured. A magnitude 7.3 earthquake affecting neighboring Algeria in 1980 killed 2,500 people.",
        "The Atlas Mountains are an intracontinental mountain belt that extends 2,000km (1,200mi) from Morocco to Tunisia. These mountains formed from a collision during the Cenozoic. The mountain range reaches its highest elevation to the west, in Morocco. The High Atlas formed during the reactivation of an ancient rift from the Triassic. However rather than extensional forces, the reactivation compressed the rift feature due to the collisional feature in the north.",
        "Seismicity in Morocco is concentrated in the country's northern region and the Alboran Sea. South of the Rif, seismic activity is sparse but spread across the Middle Atlas, High Atlas, and Anti-Atlas. Seismicity in the Saharan Atlas is limited, and absent in the Saharan region south of the belt; it is also less active eastwards in Algeria and Tunisia. Previously, the largest earthquake recorded in the Atlas Mountains was the Mw\u202f 5.9 earthquake that struck Agadir in 1960. Earthquakes in the Atlas Mountains display focal mechanisms of strike-slip, thrust or a combination of both (oblique-slip).",
        "The Marrakesh\u2013Safi earthquake is the strongest instrumentally recorded in Morocco's history, surpassed only by upper estimates of the 1755 Meknes earthquake, at Mw 6.5\u20137.0. It occurred at 19.0km (11.8mi) depth, and had a magnitude of Mww\u202f6.8, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), while Morocco's seismic agency reported a focal depth of 8km (5.0mi) and magnitude of Mwp 7.2. The Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) reported a magnitude of Mw\u202f6.9. The tremors were detected by monitoring stations as far away as Egypt. Witnesses said the shaking lasted for about 20 seconds. A magnitude 4.9 aftershock occurred 19 minutes after the mainshock, while a magnitude 4.5 aftershock was reported on 10 September.",
        "The earthquake had a focal mechanism indicating oblique-thrust faulting beneath the High Atlas. The rupture occurred on a steep-dipping oblique-reverse fault striking northwest or a shallow-dipping oblique-reverse fault striking east. The USGS estimated the fault rupture area to be 30km (19mi) by 25km (16mi). Many east-west and northeast\u2013southwest strike-slip and thrust faults occur in the High Atlas. Since 1900, there has not been a Mw\u202f 6.0 or larger earthquake within 500km (310mi) of the recent earthquake's epicentre; but nine Mw\u202f 5.0 and larger events have occurred to its east. A finite fault model by the USGS indicates rupture occurred on an east-northeast\u2013west-southwest striking, north\u2013northwest dipping thrust fault. Slip was mostly concentrated around the hypocentre within an elliptical slip patch measuring about 30km (19mi) long by 25km (16mi) wide. A maximum displacement of 1.9m (6ft 3in) was observed at 25km (16mi) depth while significant slip mainly occurred at 20\u201330km (12\u201319mi) depth; there was little to no slip close to the surface above 15km (9.3mi) depth. Generally, slip was observed at 15km (9.3mi) to 35km (22mi) depth.",
        "In another finite fault model published by Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the focal depth was determined at 24.7km (15.3mi) beneath the High Atlas. The focal mechanism of this model displayed reverse and left-lateral faulting. Slip occurred in an elliptical area along an east-northeast\u2013west-southwest trending fault dipping 69\u00b0 north\u2013northwest. Peak slip of 2m (6ft 7in) occurred at 23.3km (14.5mi).",
        "Geodetic modeling suggests the earthquake originated from within the lower crust and ruptured up to the middle crust, beneath the High Atlas. The deeper depth and greater remoteness from populated areas compared to the earthquake that struck Agadir in 1960 meant fewer casualties and damage. The range of depth where slip occurred is unusually deep for crustal earthquakes although general seismicity in the area is low.",
        "As a result, no surface faulting occurred hence the fault responsible could not be identified. The focal mechanism suggests rupture on a steep north-dipping plane or shallow south-dipping plane. The USGS finite fault is aligned with the former solution. Two dominant systems; the North and South Atlas faults; both shallow-dipping thrust faults, occur in the western High Atlas; both fault geometries do not align with that of the USGS finite fault on a steeply-dipping plane. Other unmapped faults within the range, including the Tizi n\u2019Test Fault, are closer to the surface projection of the USGS finite fault. If the rupture occurred on the shallow south-dipping plane, a possible source is a low\u2010angle detachment beneath the High Atlas. Geologists have previously interpreted low-angle faults in the region in past studies. For the steep north\u2010dipping plane, the possible source are unmapped or blind thrust faults.",
        "Vertical movement of the land surface detected by repeat observations of the Sentinel-1 satellite is consistent with movement on a blind thrust fault dipping north. The Tizi n\u2019Test Fault, a north-dipping geological fault, may have been responsible for the earthquake. No recent activity had previously been identified along the fault. An analysis of satellite data obtained from Daichi-2 by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan revealed a 20cm (7.9in) uplift of the surface around the epicenter and to the south, 7cm (2.8in) of subsidence. Surface deformation was observed around the epicenter in area measuring 50km (31mi) east and west, and 100km (62mi) north and south.",
        "According to the United States Geological Survey's PAGER service, the earthquake had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). Intensity VIII (Severe) shaking was felt by approximately 157,000 residents, including the town of Azgour and villages surrounding the Atlas Mountains. Intensity VII (Very Strong) shaking was felt by over 811,000 people, with intensity VI (Strong) shaking felt by 3.2 million residents, including in the cities of Marrakesh, Taroudant and Ouarzazate. Shaking of intensity V (Moderate) was felt in Agadir, Beni Mellal, and Safi, with intensity IV (Light) shaking being felt in Casablanca. According to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre, it was also felt in Portugal, Spain, Mauritania, Algeria, Western Sahara and along the coast of the Strait of Gibraltar.",
        "At least 2,960 people were killed and 5,674 were injured; over 2,500 of the injured were seriously hurt. Many fatalities occurred in remote locations south of Marrakesh. In Al-Haouz and Taroudant provinces, the death toll stood at 1,684 and 980, respectively. Forty-one people died in Ouarzazate; 202 died in Chichaoua and 18 deaths were recorded in Marrakesh. There were also fatalities in Casablanca, Agadir and Youssoufia. One person was injured by rockfalls in Imi N'Tala following a magnitude 3.5 aftershock on 13 September. At least 40,759 houses and 2,930 villages were damaged; 19,095 additional houses collapsed.",
        "Four French nationals and a British cyclist were among the fatalities. Fifteen French nationals and some Americans were injured. In Moulay Brahim, residents became trapped under collapsed buildings and volunteers made rescue attempts. At least 40 fatalities occurred in the village. Economic losses from the earthquake could reach up to 9 percent of Morocco's GDP, according to the USGS. At least 585 schools were damaged, seven teachers died and 39 others were injured.",
        "Some homes in older parts of Marrakesh and portions of the city walls collapsed, leaving families trapped beneath debris. At Jemaa el-Fnaa, a minaret of the Kharboush Mosque and parts of its walls collapsed, crushing vehicles below. The Kutubiyya Mosque was also damaged. Several buildings in the Medina of Marrakesh, a UNESCO World Heritage Site dating from the 12th century, also collapsed. Internet access was disrupted due to power cuts. The historic 12th-century Tinmel Mosque was extensively destroyed; a tower partially collapsed and walls fell. In Tinmel village, 15 people were killed.",
        "The Interior Ministry said the majority of damage occurred away from cities and towns. Near the epicentre in the High Atlas, public television channel Al Aoula reported many buildings collapsed. Entire villages near the epicentre were levelled. At the earthquake's epicentre in the town of Al-Haouz, a collapsed house trapped its residents under rubble. At Amizmiz, a village near the epicentre, rescuers used their hands to sort through debris. Severe damage was reported throughout most of the town, and up to 2,000 people were feared to have died there. Nearly all of the 50 traditional houses in the village of Majat were destroyed and dozens of its inhabitants were killed. Ninety-percent of houses in Asni were destroyed. In the village of Anerni, 36 people died. Additional homes in towns near the epicentre collapsed partly or completely. Electricity and roads were also cut in some areas. In Essaouira, parts of facades fell off.",
        "The towns of Tafeghaghte, Adassil and Imlil, as well as nearby villages surrounding Mount Toubkal were destroyed or severely damaged. An estimated 200 homes were destroyed in Ijoukak alone and between 80 and 100 residents, around half of its population, were killed. In Tafeghaghte, a village of 200 residents, 90 died and many remained missing. The village of Ighil, near the epicenter, was also severely damaged, however only one injury occurred, as nearly all of the village's residents were attending an outdoor wedding at the time of the earthquake. In Adassil, 32 students from the same school were killed. Outside Agadir, in the villages of Taqi and Tadrart, many homes were destroyed. At least 70 people died in the village of Imi N'Tala. In the city of Taroudant, over 400 people were killed. Several old or historic districts in the city were badly damaged. Isolated villages in the Ouirgane Valley still had no electrical and telecommunication services two days after the earthquake, while more than 30 people died in the main village. In the village of Douzrou, roughly 100 residents died. The condition in Tinzert was described as \"one giant pile of rubble\"; at least 22 deaths occurred. Moroccan television reported that more than \"18,000 families\" had been affected in Al-Haouz alone. Some residents accused authorities of preventing them from renovating their houses, which were predominantly built with mud bricks, with cement, in order to preserve their historic value and attract tourists.",
        "People in Marrakesh removed rubble by hand while awaiting heavy equipment. Many residents remained outdoors for fear of another earthquake. Posts on social media showed people evacuating a shopping centre, restaurants and apartment buildings. Residents of the city spent the first three nights outdoors; filling up roundabouts, car parks and a public square. Some businesses in the city reopened on 10 September as King Mohammed VI recommended commercial operations to continue. Unsafe portions of the city were sealed off by officials while tourists and locals continued to move about. In the capital, Rabat, 350km (220mi) north of the epicentre, and at Imsouane, a coastal town, residents left their homes.",
        "The General Secretary of the Directorate General of Internal Affairs said officials and security teams assembled resources to supply aid and assess damage. The Moroccan army cleared one of the main roads to the worst-affected areas, allowing vital assistance to reach people. In Sal\u00e9, trucks carried blankets, camp beds and lighting devices to the affected areas. Semi-trailers also carried supplies to reach these areas. Local channel 2M shared videos of emergency vehicles travelling along a dirt road. Rescue missions were disrupted as the roads through the mountainous region were congested with vehicles and fallen rocks. Collapsed buildings made from traditional mud brick, stone and rough wood complicated lowered the chances of survival as these materials disintegrated and amalgamated. The amalgamated rubble left limited air pockets for those trapped. In Al-Haouz Province, rocks were removed from roads to enable ambulances and aid to reach the affected areas. A highway in the Atlas Mountains, congested with ambulances, taxis and Red Cross members, was used to treat the injured; the severely wounded were transported to a hospital in Marrakesh. In remote areas that were difficult to access, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces used helicopters to supply basic needs. The Moroccan Health Ministry mobilized more than 2,000 doctors and nurses to respond to the earthquake.",
        "There was a surge in wounded people admitted to hospitals in Marrakesh. Injured people from outside Marrakesh also began to trickle into the city to get treatment. An appeal was made to the city's residents for blood donations. On the morning of 9 September, roughly 200 people, including tourists, visited a hospital to donate blood. Among those who donated were the Moroccan national football team. The initiative amassed 6,000 bags of blood within a day of the campaign launch. Damage assessments in Marrakesh revealed most of the city was relatively undamaged.",
        "King Mohammed VI, who was reportedly in France at the time of the earthquake, authorised the deployment of the Royal Moroccan Army in various affected cities in order to help. He also declared three days of national mourning and ordered the creation of a relief commission to provide survivors with aid, and the opening of special bank accounts to allow donations. Following a meeting with the King on 11 September, Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch, in his first remarks on the disaster, said that the government was committed to funding rebuilding and compensating those affected. King Mohammed VI also visited the Marrakesh University Hospital on 12 September, with state media saying that he met with earthquake victims and donated blood.",
        "The Army set up a field hospital in Moulay Brahim. Rescue personnel used heavy equipment to recover survivors and bodies from debris. Survivors from the village began digging graves on a hill to bury the dead. A large tent was set-up in the village to house the homeless. Operations at Marrakesh Airport remained normal but two Ryanair flights from Marrakesh to Brussels and Beauvais, France, that were scheduled for 9 September were cancelled. British Airways replaced its regular aircraft to Marrakesh with a larger one to carry British nationals requesting repatriation.",
        "Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, Jordan, Japan, South Korea, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Algeria, Argentina, France, Germany, Iran, Israel, the Philippines, Portugal, Pakistan, Romania, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Oman, Turkey, Kuwait, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations offered to provide assistance and support to Morocco. The Netherlands released \u20ac5million in emergency aid, while the Red Cross Society of China gave the Moroccan Red Crescent $200,000 for emergency humanitarian assistance. The European Commission pledged 1 million euros ($1.07million) to support relief efforts. Aerospace company Boeing announced a $300,000-donation to the American Red Cross and CARE International. Other world leaders and heads of states offered condolences.",
        "The 18-hour delay for King Mohammed VI to make an official announcement on the earthquake received criticism socially. There was also criticism of the government's delay in making an official request for assistance and that more external aid was not allowed. Frustration also grew among international aid groups on standby as they had not received formal requests. The Moroccan government did not formally ask for foreign assistance; however, they accepted aid from Qatar, Spain, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Officials said they have only approved the offer of four countries because \"a lack of coordination could be counterproductive\". They added that other offers may be approved when there is a need. On 17 September, the king sent formal messages to representatives of the four countries' search and rescue teams, thanking them for their assistance.",
        "Beno\u00eet Payan, the mayor of Marrakesh's sister city Marseille, France, announced that he was sending firefighters to Morocco to help with rescue operations. The President of the Regional Council of \u00cele-de-France Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse sent $535,000 in aid. The French Embassy in Morocco[fr] opened a crisis unit hotline. A rescue crew was sent from Nice, while communities across the country offered more than 2 million euros ($2.1million) in aid. The French government released 5 million euros ($5.4million) in aid for NGOs operating in Morocco. Arnaud Fraisse, head of Secouristes Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Rescuers Without Borders), said its teams were prevented by Moroccan authorities from entering the country on 10 September. On 10 September, Minister for Digital Affairs Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said that all French mobile phone operators had begun offering free calls and text messages to Morocco. In Belgium, a public memorial service for the victims of the earthquake was held in the city centre of Antwerp on 12 September, during which the Moroccan national anthem was played and a minute of silence for the dead was conducted. A six-man rescue team and four rescue dogs from De Rips in the Netherlands flew from Brussels to help in the search and rescue operations at the request of local residents. The town of Hilversum donated \u20ac20,000 to the victims. The Dutch Red Cross also launched a relief drive called Giro 6868 to help the victims, with about \u20ac3.8million worth of aid being received. Norway, through the country's red cross, pledged NOK 10 million in aid to the victims.",
        "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and King Abdullah II of Jordan ordered their governments to send aid to Morocco, while the United Arab Emirates's president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ordered the establishment of an air bridge to transport relief aid and other support, as did Saudi Arabia. Sultan Haitham bin Tarik of Oman ordered rescue teams and medical aid to be sent to Morocco on 10 September. On 12 September, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the earthquake and those of Storm Daniel in Libya on 10 and 11 September.",
        "Algeria, for the first time since 2021, opened its airspace to Morocco to facilitate the arrival of humanitarian aid. The following day, Algeria proposed an 80-member specialised civil protection intervention team. Spain placed its Military Emergencies Unit, its other aid agencies, and its embassy in Rabat at Morocco's disposal. Two Spanish Air Force aircraft carrying 86 soldiers and eight search dogs were flown to Marrakesh after the Moroccan government made a bilateral appeal. The Czech Republic announced it was ready to send about 70 members of a rescue team, including nine doctors, after receiving an official request from the Moroccan government. Czech Defense Minister Jana \u010cernochov\u00e1 said three military planes were prepared to transport the team.",

On 9 September, a team of 50 paramedics and personnel from Tunisia arrived. The team also brought search dogs, thermal imaging devices, a drone, and field hospital. A Qatari rescue team arrived in Morocco on 11 September. By 6 October, the Moroccan Red Crescent had supported over 50,000 people. They deployed over 290 volunteers across the affected provinces to assist in search and rescue efforts, preparing medical caravans and makeshift medical tents.",
        "The Confederation of African Football postponed the qualifying match for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations between Morocco and Liberia, which was due to be held in Agadir on 9 September. The qualifying match between the Republic of the Congo and The Gambia went ahead as scheduled in Marrakesh on 10 September. UEFA announced a moment of silence for the victims for all club and national team matches until 21 September.",
        "UNESCO experts visited the Medina of Marrakesh on 9 September to take a first look at the damage. The organization said it would provide support according to the needs expressed, with Director General Audrey Azoulay specifying \"whether it is a matter of surveying the damage in the fields of heritage and education, making buildings safe or preparing for reconstruction\".",
        "On 14 September, the monarchy announced that 50,000 houses had been damaged by the earthquake, and pledged shelter and 30,000 dirhams ($3,000) to affected households, as well as reconstruction aid of 140,000 dirhams for collapsed homes and 80,000 for damaged ones. The King also designated all children orphaned by the earthquake as \"Wards of the Nation\".",
        "The Red Cross announced the recovery process could take years; several villages near the epicentre in the remote mountainous region were completely flattened and/or inaccessible, with the paucity of infrastructure such railways, roads, and hospitals vis-\u00e0-vis the north of the country hampering relief efforts.",
        "On 20 September, a five-year-long rehousing plan estimated at US$11.7 billion was announced after a discussion with King Mohammed VI, army and government personnel. The project aims to target 4.2 million people affected in the provinces of Al-Haouz, Chichaoua, Taroudant, Marrakech, Ouarzazate and Azilal. Besides rehousing, the project also aims to promote social and economic growth in the region through improved infrastructure. The government's budget, international assistance and a reserve scheme would supply the funds needed for the project. The country promised to provide aid of US$14,000 and $8,000 for collapsed and damaged homes, respectively. Compensation of US$38,000 and $21,000 would be provided for totally destroyed and partially destroyed homes, respectively. The government would also provide monthly support over a year of US$244 to affected families. By January 2024, the government said that around 57,600 families had received the monthly support and more than 44,000 households received reconstruction aid.",
        "During the International Monetary Fund\u2013World Bank Meetings held in Marrakesh, Morocco and Spain agreed on lending \u20ac11.6 million to support the reconstruction campaign. The United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office also added it would provide \u00a31.45 million to address the immediate needs and long-term recovery. Financial assistance would target healthcare, shelter and the local agriculture industry.",
        "Offers of assistance flooded in from countries and organisations including the United States, France, Turkey, the European Commission, the African Union, the International Monetary Fund, and Algeria, which maintains tumultuous relations with Morocco. Morocco has so far delayed accepting much foreign aid. Only four countries\u2014Spain, the United Kingdom, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014have seen their offers of support officially accepted by Morocco. The president of the NGO Secouristes sans fronti\u00e8res, Arnaud Fraisse, stated, \"We do not understand this situation of blocking on the part of the Moroccan government. There is no explanation at the moment.\" The Lebanese newspaper L'Orient-Le Jour declared Morocco, \"despite being wounded, is snubbing international aid,\" forcing local officials to organise assistance.",
        "On the evening of 11 September, Algeria prepared three planes equipped with all the necessary medication and food supplies, along with a team of 93 rescuers. This came after Justice Minister Abdellatif Ouahbi's statement on television affirming that Algeria's aid was favorable and that coordination with the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs was required. Shortly after, the Moroccan press criticised Ouahbi's behavior, prompting him to clarify a few hours later that his statements had been misunderstood and misinterpreted. The aid was refused as Morocco informed the Algerian Consul in Casablanca that they did not need the proposed assistance. In contrast, Israeli NGOs began providing aid upon arrival in Morocco even without official approval from the Moroccan or Israeli governments.",
        "On 14 September, a scheduled German Red Cross flight from Leipzig to Morocco was suddenly suspended just before takeoff. In a statement, the organization said: \"for reasons beyond our control and that of our partners in the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement.\" The flight carrying aid, tents and mats was requested by the Moroccan Red Crescent.",
        "In response to these observations, the Moroccan Interior Ministry said on 10 September that its selective acceptance of aid was \"based on a precise assessment of needs on the ground\" but not an outright rejection of such offers.",
        "The Spanish newspaper El Mundo criticised the delayed reaction of King Mohammed VI as he remained \"silent for hours after the drama\". The newspaper on the other hand quoted the French ambassador in Morocco, Christophe Lecourtier[fr], who justified the delay by stating that \"the Moroccan authorities were conducting an evaluation of the situation\", since \"the southern region was isolated and far from urban centres\". This statement was echoed by spokesperson of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Anne-Claire Legendre[fr], who added that \"the needs must be established prior to making a request for help\".",
        "Another Spanish daily, El Pa\u00eds, found the king's \"silence\" in the face of the tragedy \"disturbing.\" L'Humanit\u00e9 expressed concern over the \"dangerous inertia of Moroccan power\". Having been in Paris since 1 September for medical reasons, King Mohammed VI returned to Rabat on 9 September, where images showed him in a working meeting.",
        "On 25 October 2023, hundreds of people took to the streets of Amizmiz, one of the worst-hit towns, to protest against local and regional authorities over delays in the delivery of emergency aid and cash support for the affected families. The protests, arranged by the Amizmiz Earthquake Victims\u2019 Coordination, came after a worker's strike and repeated storms that had further worsened living conditions for the residents. After a meeting with local officials, the organization called off the demonstration, but many people still went ahead with the protests. Many families had also not received cash support which was promised by the government despite providing their contact details. They were also concerned about housing as winter was approaching. In January 2024, protests were held in Talat N'Yaaqoub and in Taroudant Province over delays in the delivery of financial relief."

    "Storm Daniel": [
        "Storm Daniel, also known as Cyclone Daniel, was the deadliest Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone in recorded history, as well as one of the costliest tropical cyclones on record outside of the north Atlantic Ocean. Forming as a low-pressure system around 4September 2023, the storm affected Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey with extensive flooding. The storm then organized as a Mediterranean low and was designated as Storm Daniel. It soon acquired quasi-tropical characteristics and moved toward the coast of Libya, where it caused catastrophic flooding before degenerating into a remnant low. The storm was the result of an omega block; a high-pressure zone sandwiched between two zones of low pressure, with the isobars shaping like the Greek letter omega (\u03a9).",
        "In Greece, severe rainfall led to flooding that caused more than two billion euros in damage, making it the most costly recorded storm for the country. Libya was hit the hardest, with torrential rains causing two dams near the city of Derna to fail. This resulted in more than four thousand deaths, with between 10,000 and 100,000 people missing, although exact figures varied by source. Libya's vulnerability to such disasters was blamed on its civil war, which damaged critical infrastructure and left it in poor condition before the storm. In the aftermath, several countries along the Mediterranean Sea pledged to provide aid to affected countries.",
        "An area of low pressure developed over the Ionian Sea with its surface temperature within the range of tropical transition. On 4September 2023, it moved inland over the Balkan Peninsula which led to torrential rains, notably over the Thessaly region. The system became a Mediterranean cyclone the following day, and was named Storm Daniel by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service. Daniel transitioned into a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone on 9 September. During the following days, the system moved southeastward, peaking as a tropical storm with winds recorded by instruments on Metop at 45 knots (83km/h; 52mph).",
        "The storm made landfall near the city of Benghazi in Libya on 10September. Daniel went east and continued inland before degenerating into a low pressure-area later on, with the storm dissipating by 12 September. Climate warming may also have influenced mid-latitude atmospheric blocking in the summer, which resulted in Storm Daniel and another cold-core low that caused flooding in Spain.",
        "Storm Daniel was regarded by researchers from Yale University as the deadliest to hit Africa in recorded history, with its death toll surpassing flooding in Algeria that killed 3,000 in 1927. It was also regarded as the deadliest storm globally since at least Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and possibly Cyclone Nargis in 2008.",
        "On 5 September, flooding in Thessaly, Greece, killed at least one person. On the same day, the village of Zagora received 1,092 millimetres (43.0in) of rain, 55 times more than the country's average rainfall for the same month. Portaria also recorded a new rainfall record of 884mm (34.8in). Further rainfall could not be measured because the weather station subsequently failed. On 6September, the Krafsidonas river, which rises at Pelion, overflowed its banks in Volos and destroyed a bridge and a nursing home, while dragging cars, buses, trees, and other debris along its path.",
        "On 7 September, the main motorway between Athens and Thessaloniki was closed and train services between the two cities were suspended. In Thessaly, over 800 people had to be rescued amidst collapsed buildings and bridges and submerged villages. In Larissa, after the rains ended on 8September, water continued to rise as the Pineios river overflowed its banks to reach a level of 9.5 metres (31ft), compared to the normal level of 4m (13ft). In the Vale of Tempe, the water level rose to about 18m (59ft) meters, reaching the level of a suspension bridge.",
        "One man died in Volos when a wall collapsed on him, and in the nearby Pelion area the body of an old lady was discovered on 6 September while four people were reported missing. At least six villages in and around the Pelion mountain range suffered huge damage.",
        "Since the rainfall started, the Copernicus Programme's Rapid Mapping Service was activated for the flood zone in Greece, in which analysis of the Sentinel-1 data from 7September revealed an estimated flood area of around 73,000 hectares (180,000 acres). Meteorologists classified the storm as Greece's worst since records began in 1930. The floods in Thessaly, which supplies about 15% of Greece's agricultural production, destroyed the crops for the remainder of the year and caused serious long-term damage as the thick layer of mud made the soil infertile, taking up to five years to become fully functional again. The governor of Thessaly, Kostas Agorastos, told the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) that the storm damage in the region was calculated to be more than \u20ac2 billion. By 16 September, the death toll in the country had risen to seventeen. Among those killed were an Austrian couple who were trapped in a holiday home that was washed away by floods in Potistika, near Pelion, on 6 September.",
        "Police banned travel to Volos, certain Pelion villages and the nearby island of Skiathos. Authorities also sent text alerts to inhabitants in other areas of central Greece, on the Sporades islands and on the island of Evia near Athens, warning them to limit their movements outdoors, since flooding was forecast to continue until at least the afternoon of 7 September.",
        "Later that month, the Deputy Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, Evangelos Tournas, reported to the Hellenic Parliament that 110,000 animals were found dead and 135,000 poultry were registered as lost across Thessaly.",
        "During the initial days of the storm, five people were killed in Turkey during floods in \u0130\u011fneada, K\u0131rklareli Province. The deaths happened in the vicinity of \u0130\u011fneada Floodplain Forests National Park in an unlicensed bungalow establishment. Rising waters carried logs from a nearby forestry business and the logs dragged the houses along with them, destroying the buildings and killing the people in the process.",
        "On 6 September, the districts of Ikitelli, Arnavutk\u00f6y, Ba\u015fak\u015fehir and K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece in Istanbul were flooded due to heavy rainfall. Two died in Ba\u015fak\u015fehir and K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece, with 31 others injured. The victims were a Guinean citizen who was trapped inside his basement apartment in K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece, the other was a woman who died after being swept away by the floods in K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece. More than 1,750 homes and businesses in the city were affected. The governor of Istanbul, Davut G\u00fcl, said the city received rainfall roughly equivalent to what it would expect in the entirety of September in the space of six hours. He also said on social media that authorities would provide accommodation and safety for those affected by flooding.",
        "Villages on and near the Black Sea coast in Burgas Province, including Kosti and Arapya, became submerged, forcing evacuations. Three people were swept away after a bridge collapsed in the Tsarevo area, and another person drowned near the town.",
        "Rainfall in Kosti was measured at 311 millimetres (12.2in) (420% of the monthly average for September), in Ahtopol it amounted to 196 millimetres (7.7in) (350% of the monthly average), and in Gramatikovo to 275 millimetres (10.8in) (368% of the monthly average). In Tsarevo, rainfall was expected to set a national record, with 330 millimetres (13in) of precipitation within 20 hours (40% of the annual average). Flooding in the town prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency.",
        "A rare waterspout of approximately 80 metres (260ft) was observed in the sea near Tyulenovo in the northeast of the country.",
        "The whole southern region of Bulgaria\u2019s Black Sea coast was affected by the disaster. Most of the rivers in the region burst their banks and several bridges were destroyed, causing serious transporting and rescue problems to over 4,000 inhabitants and tourists, according to tourism minister Zaritsa Dinkova.",
        "Osama Hamada, Prime Minister of the Government of National Stability which controls eastern Libya, declared a state of emergency on 9 September and suspended classes as a precaution. The National Oil Corporation also announced a three-day closure of four oil ports including Ras Lanuf, Zueitina, Brega, and Sidra. The facilities in Ras Lanuf, Brega, and Sidra reopened on 12 September, while the port of Zueitina reopened on 13 September.",
        "In Libya, at least 4,333 people were killed, mostly in and around the city of Derna after the Derna (also known as Belad) and Mansour (or Abu Mansour) dams collapsed, releasing an estimated 30 million cubic metres (39 million cubic yards) of water, and causing catastrophic damage across the area after the Wadi Derna overflowed its banks by 50 metres (160ft) on each side. 30,000 residents were displaced.",
        "Prior to the storm, residents were prevented from leaving their homes after authorities imposed a precautionary curfew at 10:00 PM on 10 September. Residents recalled hearing loud explosions at the time the dams burst, with video showing the flood reaching Derna shortly before 03:00EET on 11 September. Prime Minister Hamada stated that residential neighborhoods were swept away. Videos posted to social media showed cars being submerged in the deluge. Four bridges also collapsed, while Hamada's aviation minister Hisham Chkiouat said that Derna looked as if it had been hit by a \"tsunami\". He also said that 25% of the city had \"disappeared\", with large parts of the city dragged out to the Mediterranean Sea.",
        "Hamada's health minister, Othman Abduljalil, said 6,000 people were missing in Derna alone. The mayor of Derna, Abdulmenam Al-Ghaithi, told al-Arabiya that the final death toll in the city could range from 18,000 to 20,000, equivalent to a fifth of the city's population. Only three of the city's ten districts escaped the flooding, while five out of seven entry routes into Derna were rendered inaccessible. The collapse of bridges along the Wadi Derna effectively split the city into two. Officials said that of the 6,142 buildings in Derna, a total of 1,500 suffered damage, of which 891 were completely destroyed, 211 partially destroyed, and the remaining 398 were submerged in mud. An estimated six square-kilometres (2.3-square-mile) of land in the city was inundated.",
        "Hospitals in the city were rendered inoperable while morgues filled up, prompting bodies to be laid out on sidewalks and in the city's main square. More than 300 bodies were sent to a morgue in Tobruk to cope with the overcrowding. More than 1,000 bodies were later buried in mass graves. Naval teams were dispatched to recover bodies swept out to sea by the floods. Over the succeeding days, at least 200 bodies were found washed up as far as 20 kilometers from Derna. Others were found more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the city. Dozens of victims were found trapped in their cars at sea. One survivor was rescued after being found 11 nautical miles (about ~20 kilometers) off the coast of Derna.",
        "The scale of the disaster in Derna was attributed to decades of neglect of the region by the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, followed by the city becoming a battleground during the civil war and concurrent NATO intervention in the 2010s and its resulting political effects that included the establishment of rival governments in the west and east of the country respectively. After Gaddafi's overthrow, the city changed hands four times. The collapsed dams were built by Yugoslav company Hidrotehnika-Hidroenergetika from 1973 to 1977 to control flooding, irrigate agricultural lands and provide water to nearby communities. They were described as clay-filled embankment dams with a height of 75 meters and 45 meters respectively.",
        "The Mansour (or Abu Mansour) dam had a water storage capacity of 1.5 million cubic meters, while the Derna (or Belad) dam upstream had a capacity of 22.5 million cubic meters (1.5 million cubic meters by another source).",
        "The two dams sustained major damage in a storm in 1986, and cracks were reported in both structures in 1998. Derna's deputy mayor said that the dams had not been maintained since 2002 and were not built to withstand such volumes of water. The lack of maintenance occurred despite the allocation of more than 2 million euros for that purpose in 2012 and 2013. However, a Turkish construction firm called Arsel Construction Company Limited claimed that it had been contracted to do maintenance work on the dam and build another one in 2007, saying that it had completed its tasks in 2012. Libyan officials repudiated the claims, saying that the company stopped work following the outbreak of the civil war in 2011.",
        "As recently as 2022, a researcher at the Omar Al-Mukhtar University in Bayda, Libya, had warned in a paper that the dams needed urgent attention, pointing out that there was \"a high potential for flood risk\". The paper also called officials to urgently carry out maintenance on the dams, prophetically stating that \u201c(in) a huge flood, the results will be catastrophic\u201d. The Wadi Derna had been known to be prone to flooding, having experienced four major floods between 1942 and 2011. It is believed that the collapse of the Derna dam, located at the convergence of two river valleys, led to waters rushing 12 kilometers (seven miles) towards the sea and overwhelming the Mansur dam, which was already under stress from rising water levels in its reservoir, along the way. Representatives of the Red Cross said that the dams' failure produced waves with a height of seven metres (23 feet).",
        "About 170 millimetres (6.7in) of rain fell in Al Abraq. Witnesses told Reuters that floodwaters rose as high as 3.0 metres (10ft). Flooding also occurred in Tobruk, Tacnis, Al-Bayada, Battah, Qandulah, and Mechili as well as throughout the Jabal al Akhdar district and in Misrata to the west. In Al-Wardiya, at least 20 of the village's 50 houses were washed out by the floods. At least 27 people were reported killed and many more were missing. There were 19 deaths reported in Susa, seven in the towns of Omar al-Mokhtar and Shahhat, and one in Marj. Eight people were reported to have died in Alfaydia. In Bayda, hospitals were evacuated due to significant flooding brought by Daniel. 200 people were killed, and dozens were missing. About 414 millimeters of rain fell in the city, equivalent to 77% of its average annual total. Around 5,000 homes, 35 kilometers of roads and 20 kilometers of drainage lines in the city suffered damage. In Marawa, around 60 farms were destroyed.",
        "Damage was also reported in archaeological sites across eastern Libya. Several structures and in situ artifacts at the ruins of Cyrene were buried in mud or swept downstream into the Mansura region. The floods also revealed previously unexcavated portions and artifacts at the site. The International Crisis Group warned that the site was at risk of collapse, citing the erosion of the site's outer walls and drainage channels and contaminated wastewater flowing through the ruins. Damage was also reported in the archaeological sites of Apollonia and Athrun, with some artifacts reportedly washed out to sea.",
        "The disaster was seen as the worst to hit the Cyrenaica region since the 1963 Marj earthquake. Conflicting figures emerged regarding the number of casualties. As of 26 September 2023, at least 4,199 people are known to have died from the storm in Libya according to Libyan authorities, with at least 170 deaths reported outside Derna, while Libyan authorities say between 10,000 and 100,000 others are missing, including seven members of the Libyan National Army. Prior to that, it was initially reported that more than 11,000 people had died according the United Nations, which in turn based its figures from the Libyan Red Crescent. However, the latter agency rejected the claims, saying that official numbers were released by Libyan authorities. About 7,000 people were reportedly injured and 46,000 were displaced, including more than 16,000 children. 117 schools were also affected, with four schools being totally destroyed and 80 others suffering partial damage. Ten hospitals and 20 other medical facilities were forced out of service by the storm. Three volunteers of the Libyan Red Crescent were killed while responding to the floods. Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the de facto ruler of eastern Libya, called the damage \"huge\" and \"hard to describe or measure\".",
        "The Libyan Football Federation confirmed the deaths of four players in its leagues, namely Shaheen Al-Jamil, a member of Premier League club Al Tahaddi based in Benghazi, Monder Sadaqa, from Premier-League club Darnes based in Derna, and brothers Saleh and Ayoub Sasi, who were members of Darnes' youth team. A fifth player, Ibrahim Al-Qaziri of Second Division club Nusour Martouba, was also reported by the BBC to have been killed. Derna Stadium also suffered severe damage from the floods.",
        "More than 400 foreign nationals were killed during the floods, including at least 276 migrants from Sudan, A member of the Sudanese community in Derna said that 700 Sudanese families in the city had been displaced by the floods. 145 Egyptian citizens, seventy-five of whom were from the village of Al-Sharif in Beni Suef, and 23 Palestinians. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated that at least 42 Syrians also died in the storm, adding that the total number of deaths could reach 150.",
        "The World Meteorological Organization said that the casualties caused by the floods could have been prevented had a functional weather service been in place in Libya, adding that its attempts to help Libyan authorities in that effort had been hampered by the prevailing security situation. The United Nations' aid chief Martin Griffiths said on 14 September that an estimated 884,000 people in the country were in need of assistance, while almost 300,000 children were at risk of exposure to post-flood diseases, violence and exploitation.",
        "The Libyan Post Telecommunications and Information Technology Company said that the storm cut off the submarine internet cable linking Libya to Europe, \"completely\" destroying the country's international communications gateway. Libya's Roads and Bridges Authority assessed that 70% of civilian infrastructure in the affected areas was destroyed by the storm, with 80% of the water system going out of service and 50% of all roads impassable, while a total of 11 bridges collapsed.",
        "Daniel reached Egypt on 11 September, where parts of the northwestern region of the country experienced moderate rainfall.",
        "As Daniel's remnants reached the Nile Delta and Cairo, residents across the country reported an unusual odor on 12 September. Manar Ghanem, a representative from the media center of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority, refuted any connection between the phenomenon and Daniel, but noted that the storm had caused dust, rain and weather fluctuations.",
        "The remnants of Daniel reached Israel on 13 September, causing unusually heavy localized rains. Minor property damage and a number of sinkholes were reported but without injuries.",
        "The Libyan Presidential Council based in Tripoli declared the cities of Derna, Shahhat, and Bayda disaster zones, while the Tripoli-based Health Ministry dispatched a plane carrying 14 tons of medical equipment, drugs, body bags, and personnel to Benghazi on 12 September. The House of Representatives (HoR) based in Benghazi, which controls most of the areas affected, declared three days of national mourning, as did the internationally recognized Government of National Unity (GNU) based in Tripoli led by Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah. Dbeibah pledged an investigation over the extensive damage, as well as the allotment of 2.5 billion Libyan dinars ($515 million) to help rebuild Derna and Benghazi, while the House of Representatives unveiled a nearly $2-billion budget for relief efforts. Dbeibah also announced the establishment of a meticulous evaluation process for foreign aid, saying that they would \"only accept aid that is deemed necessary.\"",
        "On 14 September, Dbeibah took responsibility for the collapse of the dam and the failure to enact its maintenance. On 15 September, Libyan General Prosecutor al-Sediq al-Sour (HoR) announced that he would open an investigation into the disaster in Derna. Abdulmenam Al-Ghaithi was suspended from his post as mayor of Derna, while the entire city council was dismissed and subjected to investigation on orders of Prime Minister Hamada. Serour later ordered the arrest of Ghaithi, two members of the Derna city council and 17 officials responsible for water resources and dam management on suspicion of \"bad management\" and negligence.",
        "Television channels across the country carried a joint broadcast for the first time to collect donations. Ordinary Libyans also responded to calls for help on social media, with individuals as far away as Zawiya, in GNU-controlled territory west of Tripoli, volunteering to go to Derna to assist in relief efforts.",
        "The United Nations noted that the rival governments had been coordinating with each other regarding the relief efforts. On 13 September, a GNU ministerial delegation left Tripoli to assess the damage in Derna. At the same time, reports emerged of the Libyan National Army \u2013 commanded by Khalifa Haftar \u2013 preventing journalists from entering the city and confiscating their phones. Haftar himself promised promotions to soldiers who participated in the relief efforts. The first relief convoys arrived in Derna late on 12 September. On 14 September, the port of Derna was reopened to vessels with a minimum draft level of 6.5 meters delivering humanitarian aid, while electricity was restored to the western part of the city. On the same day, the Libyan Ambulance and Emergency Service announced that remaining residents of Derna were to be evacuated and the city closed except for search-and-rescue teams. On 18 September, the GNU announced the beginning of construction of a temporary bridge across the Wadi Derna. The HoR-led administration announced that an international conference would be held in Derna on 1\u20132 November to discuss plans for its reconstruction. It also announced the establishment of a fund for the reconstruction of Derna and a compensation scheme for those displaced, with residents whose homes were destroyed receiving 100,000 dinars ($20,500), those with partially destroyed homes receiving 50,000 dinars, and those who lost furniture or household appliances receiving 20,000 dinars.",

        "The Libyan disease control agency reported on 15 September that at least 150 people had contracted diarrhea in Derna after drinking contaminated water, prompting the agency to ban affected residents from utilizing local water sources. Authorities subsequently divided Derna into four sections to create buffers in case of a disease outbreak. The HoR's Health Ministry announced the beginning of a vaccination campaign in Derna prioritizing children, rescue workers, and medical personnel. On 19 September, nearly 60 local recovery workers were hospitalized due to diarrhea and vomiting.",
        "On 17 September, a bus carrying a Greek humanitarian aid team to Derna collided with a car carrying a Libyan family east of Benghazi.

Two other occupants of the car and eight bus passengers were injured.",
        "On 18 September, residents of Derna protested outside the city\u2019s Al Sahaba Mosque and denounced the HoR and its speaker, Aguila Saleh. Some of the demonstrators later set fire to Mayor Ghaithi's residence. The protesters also called for the downfall of the HoR, the establishment of a United Nations office in the city, and an investigation of the city council and past budgets. In response, the Government of National Stability ordered the expulsion of all journalists from Derna for allegedly hampering rescue efforts and prevented a United Nations team from entering the city. Internet and telephone access was cut for 36 hours, which the state telecommunications company said was caused by the severing of fiber-optic cables due to possible sabotage. Around a dozen people were arrested, according to Libyan National Army officials.",
        "Tunisia, Germany, Qatar, Iran, Malta, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates pledged humanitarian assistance to Libya, while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said that he would deploy the country's military in coordination with eastern Libyan forces to help in relief operations. He also declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the floods as well as those of the 2023 Moroccan earthquake on 8 September. A military delegation led by armed forces chief of staff Osama Askar went to eastern Libya on 12 September to meet with Khalifa Haftar. The delegation included 25 rescue teams and three military aircraft carrying humanitarian supplies. The bodies of 84 Egyptians who were killed in Derna were repatriated from Tobruk and buried on 13 September.

The Italian government extended its state of \u201cintervention for overseas emergency\u201d for six months and allocated five million euros to support relief operations in eastern Libya. Anne-Claire Legendre, a spokesperson for France's foreign ministry, announced that the country was ready to respond to requests made by Libya's government. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the organization was on stand-by to bring support, while the commission's president Ursula von der Leyen expressed condolences. Member states Germany, Romania and Finland subsequently sent aid. The World Health Organization sent a shipment consisting of 40 tons of aid to Libya. The United Nations allocated $10 million for disaster relief.

        "In the week following the storm, more than 120 boats carrying around 7,000 migrants and refugees from Africa arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa within 24 hours, increasing the volume handled by the local migration reception center by 15 times and leading to the migrants outnumbering the island's native population. The increase was partly attributed to Storm Daniel, as people-smugglers paused operations for several days during its onslaught, thus creating a bottleneck for those stuck in North African countries such as Tunisia.",

    "Israel\u2013Hamas war": [
        "An armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups has been taking place chiefly in and around the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip. After clearing Hamas militants from its territory, the Israeli military embarked on an extensive aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion beginning on 27 October. Clashes have also occurred in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and with Hezbollah along the Israel\u2013Lebanon border. The fifth war of the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict since 2008, it is part of the broader Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War 50 years earlier.",
        "The Hamas attack on 7 October involved an estimated 3,000 militants breaching the Gaza\u2013Israel barrier and attacking Israeli civilian communities and military bases. During this attack, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals including 766 civilians and 373 security personnel were killed, while 253 Israelis and foreigners were taken captive to the Gaza Strip. Hamas said its attack was in response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, the alleged \"Judaization\" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners. In response, Israel declared a state of war, tightened its blockade and launched one of the most severe bombing campaigns in modern history, before commencing the ground invasion on 27 October. Israeli forces laid siege to Gaza City on 2 November and moved south to attack Khan Yunis a month later on 3 December; both sieges remain ongoing. Israel's next stated objective is the capture of Rafah. An estimated 6,000-12,000 Palestinian militants have been killed during the conflict, and Israel has lost over 200 soldiers during its invasion.",
        "A humanitarian crisis has developed in the Gaza Strip, with healthcare in a state of collapse, shortages of food, clean water, medicine and fuel due to the blockade, electricity and communications blackouts, and famine conditions. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the conflict,  including over 12,300 children and 8,400 women. Several thousand more are missing and presumed trapped under rubble. Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3million population have been internally displaced. A United Nations resolution calling for a humanitarian pause passed on 15 November. By the end of the month, a seven-day truce commenced, following which fighting resumed. One notable incident on 29 February 2024 led to the death of more than 100 Palestinians after Israeli troops opened fire when huge crowds raced to pull goods off an aid convoy.",
        "The war has had significant international repercussions. Popular protests that primarily call for a ceasefire have occurred across the world. Israel's actions have been denounced in the Islamic world and much of the Global South. South Africa launched proceedings at the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel is committing genocide. Israel has received significant support from its traditional Western allies, especially the United States, which vetoed multiple UN Security Council resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire. Iran-backed militias have attacked American military bases in the Middle East, while the Yemeni Houthi movement attacked commercial ships they alleged were linked to Israel, incurring a military response from a number of countries led by the United States.",
        "In 1967, following the Six-Day War fought between Israel and a coalition of Arab states (primarily Egypt, Syria, and Jordan), Israel occupied the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, which had formerly been occupied by Egypt. In 1987, the First Intifada, a popular uprising by the Palestinians against the Israeli occupation, began. The conflict lasted five years and ended with the Oslo Accords, creating the Palestinian National Authority and dividing the West Bank into three administrative areas. Following the failure of the subsequent peace talks at the Camp David Summits in 2000, violence once again escalated during the Second Intifada, which ended with the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit and Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and subsequent blockade.",
        "Hamas, an Islamist militant group, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and a subsequent battle in the Gaza Strip between it and Fatah, which led to Hamas taking over governance of Gaza, and further escalating tensions with Israel. Israel, along with Egypt, imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza's economy, citing security concerns as the justification. International rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment, while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory. The Palestinian Authority has not held national elections since 2006.",
        "Since the imposition of the blockade, Israel has been involved in numerous military confrontations with Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza. Hamas's tactics included tunnel warfare and firing rockets into Israeli territory, whereas Israel generally conducted targeted airstrikes in Gaza aiming to minimize the militant threat. The most significant prior escalations occurred in 2008-2009 and 2014, which respectively resulted in thousands of deaths (mostly Palestinian) and incurred Israeli ground invasions. In 2018-2019, there were weekly organized protests near the Gaza-Israel border involving thousands of Gazan participants. Surveys in 2023 of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank before the war indicated that a majority supported the use of \"armed struggle\", the creation of \"militant groups\", and an intifada (\"uprising\") against the Israeli occupation.",
        "The Gaza Strip's economy declined greatly due to the blockade, with a 30% drop in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) within a year. By 2015, the unemployment rate had risen to 45% (compared to the pre-blockade level of 10%). In 2023, UNRWA statistics for Gaza reported 81% of people living below the poverty level, and 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance. According to UNICEF, \"Israel only approves 64%\" of patients' requests to leave Gaza for specialized medical treatment. According to an analysis in The Independent, the Gaza blockade created hopelessness among Palestinians, which was exploited by Hamas, convincing young Palestinian men that violence was their only solution. Daoud Kuttab wrote that Palestinian attempts to solve the conflict via negotiations or non-violent boycotts have been fruitless.",
        "Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by a number of states and regional blocs, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and the European Union. Other UNSC permanent members including China and Russia do not regard Hamas as a terrorist organization. A 2018 attempt to condemn Hamas for \"acts of terror\" at the United Nations failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority, with 87 votes in favor, 58 votes against, 32 abstentions and 16 non-votes. The UN Israeli Ambassador at the time criticized the procedure, stating the vote had been \"hijacked\" due to a change in procedure requiring a two-thirds majority instead of a simple majority which would have passed the motion.",
        "In February\u2013March 2021, Fatah and Hamas reached agreement to jointly conduct elections for a new Palestinian legislative assembly, in accordance with the Oslo Accords. Hamas committed to upholding international law, transferring control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Mahmoud Abbas subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States. Soon after the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis exploded, the Al-Qassam Brigades started planning the operation which would break out on 7 October 2023.",
        "Hamas officials said shortly following the attack that it was a response to the Israeli occupation, blockade of the Gaza Strip, Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians.",
        "Mohammad Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, said in a recorded message on 7 October that it was in response to what he called the \"desecration\" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and Israel killing and wounding hundreds of Palestinians in 2023. He called on Palestinians and Arab Israelis to \"expel the occupiers and demolish the walls\". Deif also called on \"Muslims everywhere to launch an attack\" against Israel and to urged supporters to \"kill them [the enemy] wherever you may find them\". He continued, \"in light of the continuing crimes against our people, in light of the orgy of occupation and its denial of international laws and resolutions, and in light of American and western [sic] support, we've decided to put an end to all this, so that the enemy understands that he can no longer revel without being held to account.\"",
        "The long-term goals of Hamas are disputed. Hamas has repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel, notably in its 1988 charter. Some commentators have argued that Hamas is antisemitic and \"genocidal\". In 2017, Hamas replaced its old charter with a new one that removed antisemitic language and stated that its struggle was with Zionists, not Jews. The 2017 charter accepts the idea of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. However, the new charter indicates that Hamas will accept the peace agreements only provisionally, without relinquishing a claim to the entirety of Palestine nor recognizing Israel. The attack was also seen as a resolution of internal tensions within Hamas as to whether the group's main goal is governing the Gaza Strip or fighting against Israel.",
        "The disruption of Israel-Arab diplomacy and the desire to assert its presence as a significant security and political force are considered as likely motives by experts as well. In addition, internal strife in Israeli society caused by protests against the judicial reform encouraged Hamas to go ahead with its attack.",
        "On 21 January 2024, Hamas released an 18-page English-language document reiterating its previously stated rationales and framing the attack in a wider context as a struggle against colonialism, describing its actions as \"a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people\". It said that \"maybe some faults happened\" during the attacks \"due to the rapid collapse of the Israeli security and military system, and the chaos caused along the border areas with Gaza\" and that \"[if] there was any case of targeting civilians it happened accidentally\". The timing of the release raised questions; sources in Gaza, including those aligned with Hamas, told Haaretz that the document was designed to contend with criticism of the heavy price Gazans have paid for the attacks on Israel.",
        "Benjamin Netanyahu has been Israel's prime minister for nearly the entire 15 year period preceding the war, with the exception of the 18 months from June 2021 to January 2023 when Naftali Bennett and later Yair Lapid took office. Both governments have been criticized for having championed a policy of empowering the Hamas government in Gaza by, for instance, granting work permits to Gazan residents, facilitating the transfer of funds to Hamas and maintaining relative calm. By the conclusion of Netanyahu's fifth government in 2021, the issuance of work permits to Gazans reached approximately 2,000-3,000. Later, under the Bennett-Lapid government, this number significantly increased to 10,000, and since Netanyahu's return to power in 2023 the number rose again to 20,000. These workers were accused of spying on Israel and complicit of the October 7 attack. After the attack, the Israeli war cabinet granted additional 8,000 permits for agricultural works to West Bank residents, despite concerns about their vetting and potential security risks.",
        "In addition to granting workers permits, millions of dollars from Qatar have been transported into Gaza, escorted by Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, intended for Gaza's power plant, infrastructure projects and monthly stipends for impoverished Palestinian families, while Israeli officials were aware that Hamas might divert the funds to acquire weapons and rockets.",
        "These strategies towards Hamas have been criticized as having backfired in light of the attacks on 7 October 2023. Critics, including human-rights activists and aid organizations, cautioned that such policies may have prolonged Hamas's power in Gaza while weakening Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, thus sabotaging a two-state solution. This criticism has been echoed by several Israeli officials, including former prime minister Ehud Barak and former head of the Shin Bet internal security service Yuval Diskin. The Palestinian Authority and Saudi Arabia were also critical of Netanyahu's government allowing Qatar to deliver suitcases of money to Hamas in exchange for maintaining the ceasefire. A Times of Israel op-ed argued after the Hamas attack that Netanyahu's policy to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset had \"blown up in our faces\". Netanyahu himself has criticized opinions on his responsibility for the 7 October attacks, stating \"Did people ask Franklin Roosevelt, after Pearl Harbor, that question? Did people ask George Bush after the surprise attack of November [sic] 11?\" referring to the 11 September 2001 terror attacks.",
        "Numerous commentators have identified the broader context of Israeli occupation as a cause of the war. The Associated Press wrote that Palestinians are \"in despair over a never-ending occupation in the West Bank and suffocating blockade of Gaza\". Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, B'Tselem and Human Rights Watch have likened the Israeli occupation to apartheid, although supporters of Israel dispute this characterization. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported roughly 6,400 Palestinians and 300 Israelis were killed in the wider Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict from 2008 through September 2023 before the start of this war.",
        "Over the course of 2023, before the October 7 attack, 32 Israelis and two foreign nationals had been killed in Palestinian attacks, while at least 247 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli forces. Increases in settler attacks had displaced hundreds of Palestinians, and there were clashes around the Al-Aqsa Mosque which sits on the Temple Mount, a contested holy site in Jerusalem.",
        "In August 2023, 1,264 Palestinians were held in administrative detention in Israel, without charge or trial, the highest number in three decades. Israel says this tactic is necessary to contain dangerous militants.",
        "Tensions between Israel and Hamas rose in September 2023, and the Washington Post described the two \"on the brink of war\". Israel found explosives hidden in a shipment of jeans and halted all exports from Gaza. In response, Hamas put its forces on high alert, and conducted military exercises with other groups, including openly practicing storming Israeli settlements. Hamas also allowed Palestinians to resume protests at the Gaza\u2013Israel barrier. On 13 September, five Palestinians were killed at the border. According to the Washington Post, the Palestinians were attempting to detonate an explosive device. Al-Jazeera reported that a Palestinian Explosives Engineering Unit was working to deactivate the device. On 29 September, Qatar, the UN, and Egypt mediated an agreement between Israel and Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip to reopen closed crossing points and deescalate tensions.",
        "Simon Tisdall argues that an uptick in Israeli\u2013Palestinian violence in the West Bank in the first half of 2023 had portended war, and stated that Netanyahu's \"refusal to contemplate any type of peace process\" added \"fuel to the smouldering fire\" in the context of \"the relentless expansion of illegal Israeli settlements\". Prior to the attack, Saudi Arabia warned Israel of an \"explosion\" as a result of the continued occupation, Egypt had warned of a catastrophe unless there was political progress, and similar warnings were given by Palestinian Authority officials. Two months before the attacks, King Abdullah II of Jordan commented that Palestinians have \"no civil rights; no freedom of mobility\".",
        "Israeli intelligence officials initially stated that they had no warnings or indications of the 7 October attack by Hamas, despite Israel exercising extensive monitoring over Gaza. Furthermore, the United States warned the Israeli government of the possibility of a surprise attack from Hamas a few days before the incident. Egypt said it warned Israel days before the attack, \"an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big\". Israel denied receiving such a warning, but the Egyptian statement was corroborated by Michael McCaul, Chairman of the US House Foreign Relations Committee, who said warnings were made three days before the attack.",
        "According to the New York Times, Israeli officials had obtained detailed attack plans more than a year prior to the actual attack. The document described operational plans and targets, including the size and location of Israeli forces, and raised questions in Israel as to how Hamas was able to learn these details. The document provided a plan that included a large scale rocket assault prior to an invasion, drones to knock out the surveillance cameras and gun turrets that Israel has deployed along the border, and gunmen invading Israel, including with paragliders. The Times reported that \"Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision\". According to the Times, the document was circulating among Israeli military and intelligence leadership, who largely dismissed the plan as being beyond Hamas's capabilities, though it was unclear if the political leadership was informed. In July 2023, a member of the Israeli signals intelligence unit alerted her superiors that Hamas was conducting preparations for the assault, saying that \"I utterly refute that the scenario is imaginary\". An Israeli colonel ignored her concerns. According to the Financial Times, alerts from the signals unit were ignored because they came from lower-ranking soldiers, contradicted the belief that Hamas was contained by Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, bombing, and placation via aid, and the belief that Hamas was seeking to avoid a full war.",
        "At the time of the attack, Israel and Saudi Arabia were conducting negotiations to normalize relations. Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman said normalization was \"for the first time real\". According to US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the aim of the 7 October attacks was to disrupt the normalization talks. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli normalization with other Middle Eastern states, including Saudi Arabia, threatened to leave the Palestinians \"isolated and weak\".",
        "As of 7 February 2024, Saudi Arabia confirmed that diplomatic relations with Israel requires an independent Palestinian state on 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.",
        "The attack took place during the Jewish holidays of Simchat Torah and Shemini Atzeret on Shabbat, and one day after the 50th anniversary of the start of the Yom Kippur War, which also began with a surprise attack. At around 6:30a.m. IDT (UTC+3) on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes. Israeli sources reported that at least 3,000 projectiles had been launched from Gaza. At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks. Explosions were reported in areas surrounding the strip and in cities in the Sharon Plain including Gedera, Herzliyya, Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon. Air raid sirens were activated in Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Rehovot, Rishon Lezion, and Palmachim Airbase. Hamas issued a call to arms, with commander Mohammad Deif calling on \"Muslims everywhere to launch an attack\" and to \"kill them [the enemy] wherever you may find them\".",
        "Hamas employed tactics such as using aerial drones to disable Israeli observation posts, paragliders for infiltration into Israel, and motorcycles, which was unusual for Hamas. Palestinian militants opened fire on Israeli boats, while clashes broke out between Palestinians and the Israel Defense Forces along the Gaza perimeter fence. In the evening, Hamas launched another barrage of 150 rockets towards Israel, with explosions reported in Yavne, Givatayim, Bat Yam, Beit Dagan, Tel Aviv, and Rishon Lezion.",
        "Simultaneously, around 3,000 Hamas militants infiltrated Israel from Gaza using trucks, pickup trucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and paragliders. They took over checkpoints at Kerem Shalom and Erez, and created openings in the border fence in five other places. Images and videos showed armed and masked militants, riding pickup trucks and opening fire in Sderot. Other videos display Israelis taken prisoner, a burning Israeli tank, and militants driving Israeli military vehicles.",
        "Hamas has also stated that its attack was in response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, rising Israeli settler violence and recent escalations at Al-Aqsa. Intelligence and security officials from multiple Western countries say that Hamas initiated the war to create a \"permanent\" state of war and to revive interest in the Palestinian cause.",
        "Hamas militants carried out an amphibious landing in Zikim. A military base near Nahal Oz was also taken by the militants, leaving at least two Israeli soldiers dead and six others captured. The IDF said it killed two attackers on the beach and destroyed four vessels, including two rubber boats. Fighting was reported at Re'im military base, headquarters of Israel's Gaza Division. It was later reported that Hamas took control of the base and took several Israeli soldiers captive, before the IDF regained control later in the day. The police station of Sderot came under Hamas control, with militants killing 30 Israelis, including policemen and civilians. At least six Israeli military bases near the Gaza border were attacked.",
        "Militants killed civilians at Nir Oz, Be'eri, and Netiv HaAsara, and other agricultural communities, where they took hostages and set fire to homes. This resulted in widespread fires and smoke across the region. 52 civilians were killed in the Kfar Aza massacre, 108 in the Be'eri massacre (a loss of 10% of the kibbutz's population) and 15 in the Netiv HaAsara massacre, in what has been described as the bloodiest day in Israel's history and the worst single-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. In Sderot, gunmen targeted civilians and set houses ablaze. In Ofakim, hostages were taken during Hamas's deepest incursion. Hamas said it took prisoners to force Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. In Be'eri, Hamas militants took up to 50 people hostage. Videos showed hostages being led barefoot across a street in the town. At least 325 people were killed and more injured at an outdoor music festival near Re'im and Hamas took at least 37 attendees hostage.\nWitnesses recounted militants on motorcycles opening fire on participants who were already fleeing due to rocket fire. Graeme Wood reported that the video footage retrieved from the body cameras of Hamas militants displayed several victims \"in the beginning of the footage they are alive, by the end they're dead. Sometimes, in fact frequently, after their death their bodies are still being desecrated\".",
        "Around 240 people were taken hostage during the attacks, mostly civilians. Captives in Gaza include children, festivalgoers, peace activists, caregivers, elderly people, and soldiers.",
        "An Israeli spokesman said militants had entered Israel through at least seven locations from both land and sea, and invaded four small rural Israeli communities, the border city of Sderot, and two military bases. Israeli media reported that seven communities came under Hamas control, including Nahal Oz, Kfar Aza, Magen, Be'eri, and Sufa, and there were 21 active high-confrontation locations in southern Israel.",
        "Hamas and the Palestinian Authority denied the massacre, stating that Israeli helicopters and fighter jets were behind the high number of casualties. An Israeli Police investigation stated that the first helicopters at the scene arrived hours after the massacre began, and that they were likely responsible for only a few friendly fire casualties.",
        "In Be'eri, an Israeli tank fired on a house known to contain around 40 Hamas fighters and 14 hostages, among them 2 children; only one of the hostages in the house survived. The families of those killed demanded an investigation. A Ynet article stated that there was an \"immense and complex quantity\" of friendly-fire incidents during the 7 October attack that \"it would not be morally sound to investigate\" given their number and the challenges soldiers were facing at the time. In January 2024, an investigation by Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronoth concluded that the IDF had in practice applied the Hannibal Directive, ordering all combat units to stop \"at all costs\" any attempt by Hamas terrorists to return to Gaza, even if there were hostages with them. It is unclear how many hostages were killed by friendly fire as a result of the order.",
        "In the aftermath of the initial Hamas assault, witnesses from the Israeli soldiers, the Israeli Department Forces, and the first responder Israeli organization ZAKA said on French Israeli TV channel i24news that they had seen the bodies of beheaded infants at the site of the Kfar Aza massacre. An Israeli ZAKA volunteer reported on 14 October seeing children's bodies with severe injuries and burns. Some of the bodies appeared to have been decapitated, but the exact circumstances were not clear. These and a number of other, similar stories about murdered babies and children, told by soldiers and ZAKA volunteers and later repeated by politicians, were later found to be untrue. During Antony Blinken's visit to Israel, he said he was shown photos of the massacre by Hamas of Israeli civilians and soldiers, and specifically that he saw beheaded IDF soldiers. U.S. President Biden separately said that he had seen photographic evidence of beheaded children; the White House subsequently clarified that Biden was alluding to news reports of beheadings, which have not contained or referred to photographic evidence. NBC News called reports of \"40 beheaded babies\" unverified allegations, adding that they appeared \"to have originated from Israeli soldiers and people affiliated with the Israel Defense Force\" and that \"an Israeli official told CNN the government had not confirmed claims of the beheadings\". The allegation mainly \"stemmed from a viral Israeli news broadcast clip\" and the main X / Twitter accounts propagating the statements were i24NEWS and Israel's official account, even though Israeli Defense spokesperson Doron Spielman told NBC News that he could not confirm i24NEWS's report. As of 12 October, CNN had extensively reviewed online media content to verify Hamas-related atrocities but found no evidence to support statements about decapitated children.",
        "According to The Jerusalem Post, which reprinted an article from the Israeli website Themedialine.org (whose founder, Felice Friedson, was praised by The Jerusalem Post and is a contributor to it), approximately 200 forensic pathologists and other experts\u2014from Israel, Switzerland, New Zealand, the U.S. and elsewhere\u2014reviewed evidence of the attack at the National Center of Forensic Medicine (Abu Kabir) in Tel Aviv. Chen Kugel, head of the center, said that many bodies, including those of babies, were without heads. When asked whether the bodies had been decapitated, Kugel answered yes. He added that it was difficult to determine whether the dead were decapitated before or after death, or whether their heads had been \"cut off by knife or blown off by RPG\".",
        "On 24 October, Israeli authorities screened bodycam footage of Hamas atrocities for journalists, including \"an attempt to decapitate someone who appeared to be still alive using a garden hoe\", as well as a still image of a decapitated IDF soldier.",
        "On 4 December, Haaretz reported that \"unverified stories [had been] disseminated by Israeli search and rescue groups, army officers and even Sara Netanyahu\". Haaretz journalists Nir Hasson and Liza Rozovsky related the chronology of the news items about \"beheaded babies\" and \"hung babies\" and concluded, \"this story is false\". They quoted Ishay Coen, a journalist for the ultra-Orthodox website Kikar Hashabbat, who admitted he made a mistake by unquestioningly accepting the IDF's statements. \"Why would an army officer invent such a horrifying story?\", Hashabbat asked, adding, \"I was wrong\". A ZAKA volunteer's story about a baby having been cut from a pregnant woman's womb was likewise found to be made up; in total only two babies are actually known to have died on October 7: one was struck by a bullet, the other was an injured Bedouin woman's baby that died in hospital shortly after birth.",
        "After the initial breach of the Gaza perimeter by Palestinian militants, it took hours for the Israeli military to start its counter-attack.\nThe first helicopters sent to support the military were launched from the north of Israel, and arrived at the Gaza Strip an hour after fighting began. They immediately encountered difficulty in determining which outposts and communities were occupied, and distinguishing between Palestinian militants and the soldiers and civilians on the ground. The helicopter crews initially sustained a high rate of fire, attacking approximately 300 targets in 4 hours. Later on the crews began to slow down the attacks and carefully select targets.\nAccording to Haaretz's journalist Josh Breiner, a police source said that a police investigation indicated an IDF helicopter which had fired on Hamas militants \"apparently also hit some festival participants\" in Re'im music festival massacre. The Israeli police denied the Haaretz report.",
        "A subsequent Israeli investigation claimed that militants had been instructed not to run so that the air force would think they were Israelis. This deception worked for some time, but pilots began to realize the problem and ignore their restrictions. By around 9:00am, amid the chaos and confusion, some helicopters started laying down fire without prior authorization.",
        "The attack appeared to have been a complete surprise to the Israelis. Prime Minister Netanyahu convened an emergency gathering of security authorities, and the IDF launched Operation Swords of Iron in the Gaza Strip. In a televised broadcast, Netanyahu said, \"We are at war\". He threatened to \"turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins\", called Gaza \"the city of evil\", and urged its residents to leave. Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant conducted security assessments at IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. Overnight, Israel's Security Cabinet voted to act to bring about the \"destruction of the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad\". The Israel Electric Corporation, which supplies 80% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, cut off power to the area. This reduced Gaza's power supply from 120 MW to 20 MW, provided by power plants paid for by the Palestinian Authority.",
        "The IDF declared a \"state of readiness for war\", mobilized tens of thousands of army reservists, and declared a state of emergency for areas within 80 kilometers (50mi) of Gaza. The Yamam counterterrorism unit was deployed, along with four new divisions, augmenting 31 existing battalions. Reservists were reported deployed in Gaza, in the West Bank, and along borders with Lebanon and Syria.",
        "Residents near Gaza were asked to stay inside, while civilians in southern and central Israel were \"required to stay next to shelters\". The southern region of Israel was closed to civilian movement, and roads were closed around Gaza and Tel Aviv. While Ben Gurion Airport and Ramon Airport remained operational, multiple airlines cancelled flights to and from Israel. Israel Railways suspended service in parts of the country and replaced some routes with temporary bus routes, while cruise ships removed the ports of Ashdod and Haifa from their itineraries.",
        "Following the surprise attack, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas compounds, command centers, tunnels, and other targets. Israel employed its artificial intelligence Habsora (\"The Gospel\") software with a new and superior capacity to automatically generate targets to be attacked. Two days after the surprise attack, Israel said that 426 Hamas targets had been hit, including destroying Beit Hanoun, homes of Hamas officials, a mosque, and an internet hub. Israel also rescued two hostages before declaring a state of war for the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Defense Minister Gallant announced a \"total\" blockade of the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity and blocking the entry of food and fuel, adding \"We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly\". This drew criticism from Human Rights Watch who described the order as \"abhorrent\" and as a \"call to commit a war crime\". The first aid convoy after the start of the war entered Gaza on 21 October 2023, while fuel entered Gaza only in November.",
        "The IDF later deployed C-130 and C-130J transport aircraft to retrieve off-duty personnel from abroad.",
        "As a part of a bombing run targeting Hamas command centers and weapon caches, the IDF stated that it had bombed the Nukhba forces\u2014a Hamas special forces unit that is thought to have led the attack on Israel.",
        "Human Rights Watch accused Israel of using white phosphorus munitions over Gaza on 10 and 11 October, stating that it violated international law. Israel denied the allegations.",
        "Almost a week after the initial attack on Israel, on 13 October, the IDF issued an evacuation warning for communities north of the Wadi Gaza. All Palestinians in that region, including those in Gaza City, were given 24 hours to evacuate to the south. The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs responded by telling residents in northern Gaza to \"remain steadfast in your homes and stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation\".",
        "The statement by Israel faced widespread backlash; with numerous agencies, such as Doctors Without Borders, the World Health Organization, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, among others, condemning the order as \"outrageous\" and \"impossible\" while calling for an immediate reversal of the order.",
        "As a part of the order, the IDF announced a six-hour window from 10a.m. to 4p.m. local time on 13 October, for refugees to flee south along specified routes within the Gaza Strip. An explosion at 5:30p.m. along one of the safe routes killed 70 people. Some sources attributed it to an IDF airstrike, while CNN said the cause was unclear. The Jerusalem Post said open-source analysts believed the explosion originated from a car on the ground, but the cause was unclear. The Financial Times carried out an investigation, concluding \"analysis of the video footage rules out most explanations aside from an Israeli strike\", although it was \"difficult to conclusively prove whether these blasts came from an IDF strike, a potential Palestinian rocket misfire or even a car bomb\".",
        "The IDF stated Hamas set up roadblocks to keep Gaza residents from evacuating south and caused traffic jams. Israeli officials stated this was done to use civilians as \"human shields\", which Hamas denied. A number of countries and international organizations condemned what they called Hamas's use of hospitals and civilians as human shields.",
        "According to an unnamed Israeli official, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar left Gaza City using a vehicle associated with a humanitarian relief mission.",
        "On 17 October, Israel bombed in areas of southern Gaza. Ministry of Health officials in Gaza reported heavy overnight bombing killing over 70 people, including families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north. One of the airstrikes killed a senior Hamas military commander Ayman Nofal. In the afternoon, an Israeli strike hit a UNRWA school in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp, killing six and injuring 12.",
        "Late in the evening, an explosion occurred in the parking lot of the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist Hospital in the center of Gaza City, killing hundreds. The cause of the explosion was disputed by Hamas and the IDF, and the ongoing conflict prevented independent on-site analysis. Palestinian statements that it was an Israeli airstrike were denied by the IDF, which stated that the explosion resulted from a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The PIJ denied any involvement. An independent analysis by Human Rights Watch indicated that the evidence pointed to a misfired Palestinian rocket as the cause, but stated that further investigation was required.",
        "On 18 October, President Biden said the Pentagon had independently concluded that the explosion was not caused by Israel, but by \"the other team\", based on data from the Defense Department. Over the next few days, Canadian, British, and French officials announced that their respective intelligence agencies concluded the cause to be a failed Palestinian rocket and not an Israeli airstrike. In its article dated 2 November, CNN stated that multiple experts said \"they believe this to be the most likely scenario \u2013 although they caution the absence of munition remnants or shrapnel from the scene made it difficult to be sure. All agreed that the available images of evidence of the damage at the site was not consistent with an Israeli airstrike.\"",
        "On 27 October, the IDF launched a large-scale ground incursion into northern Gaza. Clashes between Hamas and the IDF were reported near Beit Hanoun and Bureij. The Israeli invasion of Gaza was confirmed after Israel said its units were still in Gaza the next day. Hamas leader Ali Baraka said the invading Israeli forces suffered heavy casualties and loss of equipment due to an ambush. Two days later, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), described as \"deeply concerning\" reports from the Palestinian Red Crescent that the al-Quds hospital had received an urgent evacuation warning. He reiterated that it was \"impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives\". Israeli airstrikes targeted the area around the hospital, filling parts of the building with smoke and dust, prompting staff to give breathing masks to some patients. Around 14,000 civilians were believed to be sheltering in or near the hospital. Associated Press reported that Israeli airstrikes also destroyed roads leading to the Al-Shifa hospital, making it increasingly difficult to reach.",
        "Three days following the beginning of ground operations, a video showed an Israeli tank firing on a taxi with a white flag on its roof that had attempted to turn around. An IDF spokesperson said they were \"not shown any proof\" that the vehicle was civilian, adding, \"terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars\".",
        "The following day, the IDF struck at densely-populated Jabalia refugee camp, killing 50 and wounding 150 Palestinians according to the Gaza Health Ministry. According to Israel, a senior Hamas commander and dozens of militants in a vast underground tunnel complex were among those killed. Hamas denied the presence of a senior commander on the scene. According to the IDF, the destruction of the tunnels caused the collapse of the foundations of several nearby buildings, leading to their collapse. Eyewitnesses interviewed by CNN and Der Spiegel spoke of \"apocalyptic\" scenes, with dozens of collapsed buildings, children carrying other injured children, and bodies lying in the rubble. The nearby Indonesian Hospital's surgical director said they had received 120 dead bodies and treated 280 wounded, the majority of them women and children. The attack resulted in several ambassador recalls (see \u00a7Ambassador recalls). Josep Borrell, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, wrote on the social media platform X that he was \"appalled by the high number of casualties\" from the bombing. According to The New York Times at least two 2,000-pound bombs, the second largest type in Israel's arsenal, were used.",
        "On 1 November, the first group of evacuees left Gaza for Egypt. 500 evacuees, comprising critically wounded and foreign nationals, would be evacuated over the course of several days, with 200 evacuees already waiting at the border crossing. On the same day, the Jabalia refugee camp was bombed for a second time; the UN Human Rights Office expressed \"serious concerns\" that these were \"disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes\". The IDF released what it stated was an intercepted call between Hamas operatives and the head of the Indonesia Hospital, where they discuss diverting some of the hospital's fuel supply to Hamas.",
        "Two days later, the Gaza health ministry stated that Israel struck an ambulance convoy directly in front of Al-Shifa Hospital, killing at least 15 people and injuring 60 more. The IDF acknowledged having launched an airstrike at \"an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone\", adding that a \"number of Hamas terrorist operatives were killed in the strike\". The IDF did not provide evidence that the ambulances were being used by Hamas combatants but said that additional information would be released. A Hamas official described the Israeli statement as \"baseless\". The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said one of its ambulances was struck \"by a missile fired by the Israeli forces\" about two metres from the entrance to al-Shifa hospital. The PRCS said another ambulance was fired on about a kilometre from the hospital. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X that he was \"utterly shocked by reports of attacks on ambulances evacuating patients\", adding that patients, health workers and medical facilities must always be protected.",
        "On 4 November a UNRWA spokeswoman confirmed reports that Israel had conducted an airstrike against a UN-run school in the Jabalia refugee camp. According to the Gaza health ministry, the attack killed 15 and wounded dozens more.",

        "Fighting continued through the middle of November and on 18 November Israeli strikes killed more than 80 people in Jabalia refugee camp. On 22 November, Israel and Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire agreement, providing for a four-day \"pause\" or \"lull\" in hostilities, to allow for the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza. The deal also provided for the release of approximately 150 Palestinian women and children incarcerated by Israel. The agreement was approved by the Israeli cabinet in the early hours of the day; in a statement, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office stated Israel's intention to continue the war.",
        "Following the introduction of a Qatari-brokered truce on 24 November, starting at 7:00am Israel time, active fighting in the Gaza Strip ceased and some of the Israeli and foreign hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel. The truce was announced for a period of four days, but was extended for a longer period.",
        "From 24 to 30 November, Hamas released hostages and Israel released prisoners. On 27 November, Qatar announced that an agreement between Israel and Hamas to extend the truce by two days had been reached. Both Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the truce on 28 November. On 30 November, Hamas released two more hostages as the truce, which was supposed to end minutes later, was extended by another day.",
        "The truce expired in the morning on 1 December, as both Israel and Hamas blamed the other side for failing to agree on an extension. According to the New York Times, the disagreement centered on \"how to define soldiers versus civilians and how many Palestinian prisoners Israel would release for its hostages\". The remaining hostages include a year old baby, his 4 year old brother and their mother, an additional 13 women aged 18-39, and 85 men, some of whom are over the age of 70 and 80. A Hamas official said that after the exchange, the only remaining hostages were \"soldiers and civilian men who served in the occupation army\", and refused to exchange them until \"all our prisoners are freed and a ceasefire takes hold\". US National Security Advisor John Kirby said that \"Hamas agreed to allow the Red Cross access to these hostages while the pause was in place\", which \"didn't happen and is still not happening\".",
        "Israel adopted a grid system to order precise evacuations within Gaza, released a map online, and dropped leaflets with a QR code for the link. The maps were criticized for being hard to access due to the lack of electricity and internet connectivity, and for causing confusion or panic. Some evacuation instructions have been vague or contradictory, and Israel still operated in areas it had told people to evacuate to and that were safe for civilians.",
        "Two law experts said they had not seen significant changes in previous days of how Israel waged the war, due to its warnings to civilians appearing ineffective and it being unclear if anywhere in Gaza is truly safe. Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said in a press release that \"US-made weapons facilitated the mass killings of extended families\". Amnesty found no evidence of military targets at the sites of the strikes, or any indication that the occupants of the homes were affiliated with Hamas, prompting the group to request that the airstrikes be investigated as possible war crimes. Several decomposed babies were found in the ICU of Al-Nasr Children's Hospital in northern Gaza, two weeks after its forced evacuation. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warned against replacing \"a tactical victory with a strategic defeat\" if Israel does not work towards protecting Palestinian civilians. The US State Department said it was too early to definitively assess whether Israel was heeding US calls to protect civilians.",

        "On 7 December, Israel detained 150 men in the Gaza Strip, with dozens more detained on 10 December. According to Israel, the detentions followed a mass surrender of Hamas militants. The New York Times reported that the statement about Hamas fighters surrendering was made after video and photographs of \"men stripped to their underwear, sitting or kneeling on the ground, with some bound and blindfolded\" were seen on social media.The Guardian reported that among the people seen in the images were people identified as civilians, among them a journalist. The ICRC said it was concerned by the images and that it strongly emphasized \"the importance of treating all those detained with humanity and dignity, in accordance with international humanitarian law\". The BBC reported that a video of the apparent surrender of weapons is unclear whether a man is \"surrendering\" weapons or just moving them as instructed, suggested the event was performed for the camera, rather than as an act of authentic surrender, and that it not known whether the individuals shown have any involvement with Hamas or the 7 October attack. Haaretz reported that Israeli security officials believed that approximately 10\u201315% of the people shown in the video were actually affiliated with Hamas, and that despite the public statements by Israel that this was not a \"massive surrender\" by Hamas units. Amnesty International described the treatment of those detained on 7 December as a violation of international law.",
        "On 8 and 9 December, the IDF released footage of what it said was its soldiers engaging combatants near and inside two schools in Shejaiya. According to the IDF, fighters also discovered a tunnel leading from one of the schools to a nearby mosque. It also released footage of armament that it stated was found on the campus of Al-Azhar University, along with a tunnel shaft leading to a school 1km away.

        "On 15 December, the IDF released a statement announcing that they had killed three of their own hostages by friendly fire. According to the Israeli military, they \"mistakenly identified three Israeli hostages as a threat\" during operations in Shuja'iyya and subsequently fired at them, killing them. According to an Israeli military official on 16 December, the three hostages were shirtless and were carrying \"a stick with a white cloth on it\" when an Israeli soldier, who declared them to be \"terrorists\" after feeling \"threatened\", opened fire, killing two hostages and injuring the third, who was killed by Israeli reinforcements.",

        "On 22 January, 24 IDF soldiers died in what was the deadliest day for the IDF since the ground invasion began. Of these, 21 died in a single incident where Palestinian militants fired an RPG at a tank as well as at adjacent buildings soldiers were rigging to demolish which thus caused the buildings to collapse. The IDF soldiers brought landmines into the empty building for the demolition process. It is unclear whether the collapse of the buildings was principally due to the primary RPG explosion or the secondary landmine explosions. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and President Isaac Herzog publicly mourned the loss.",
        "In February, the Israeli government stated on several occasions its next objective would be the capture of Rafah. On 12 February, Israel started the bombing campaign on Rafah. On February 15, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Egypt was building a refugee camp for over 100,000 people south of Rafah, surrounded by five-meter-high concrete walls. However, the governor of North Sinai Governorate, Mohamed Abdel-Fadil Shousha, denied these rumors in a statement published by Al-Arabiya. On 18 February, Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz warned that a ground offensive will be launched in Rafah on 10 March unless Hamas has freed all hostages by then. Gantz added Israel would act in \"a co-ordinated manner, facilitating the evacuation of civilians in dialogue with our American and Egyptian partners to minimise civilian casualties\".",
        "On 29 February, more than 100 Palestinians were killed and 750 were wounded during the flour massacre  when Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians waiting for food aid southwest of Gaza City, with many victims run over by trucks according to some accounts. Survivors described it as an ambush, stating that Israeli forces opened fire as people approached the aid trucks, resulting in a rush away from the gunfire that added to the death toll.\nOn 1 March, the United States announced they would begin an operation airdropping food aid into Gaza. Some experts called the US airdrops performative and claimed they would do little to alleviate the food situation in Gaza. President Biden announced a Gaza floating pier would be constructed by the US in his 2024 State of the Union Address to deliver aid.",

From 7 to 31 October, B'Tselem said that Israeli forces had killed more than 100 Palestinians while Israeli settlers had killed at least seven, leading to fears that the situation would escalate out of control. About 1,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settlers since 7 October and almost half of clashes have included \"Israeli forces accompanying or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out the attacks\" according to a U.N. report.

Any ship destined for Israel, according to the group, was a \"legitimate target\". Saree announced in a post on X that the \"horrific massacres\" against the Palestinians in Gaza was the reason for this decision and that they will not stop until the Gaza Strip is supplied with food and medicine.

As of 15 October 47 families had been completely wiped away from the population registry, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Financial Times reported how Palestinian families could have multiple generations living in a single multistory building has had the effect of those families being nearly completely wiped out by airstrikes. As of 23 November, according to Gazan health officials, 312 families had suffered the loss of more than 10 members.

An Israeli official responded that the charge was \"blood-libellous\" and \"delusional\". Human Rights Watch similarly found that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war by deliberately denying access to food and water. On 16 January 2024, UN experts accused Israel of \"destroying Gaza's food system and using food as a weapon against the Palestinian people\". Michael Fakhri, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, said that Israel is intentionally starving Palestinians, stating \"Intentionally depriving people of food is clearly a war crime\" and that Israel was intending to \"destroy the Palestinian people, in whole or in part, simply for being Palestinian.\" On 3 March 2024, Fakhri stated that \"famine may very well be already occurring\".",

The 29,000 munitions -shells and bombs- Israel has dropped on Gaza in 3 months greatly exceed those (3,678) dropped by the United States between 2004 and 2010 during its Invasion of Iraq. Nearly 70% of homes in Gaza and roughly half of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. As of January 2024, Israel's offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70\u201380% of all buildings in northern Gaza. The damage to buildings in northern Gaza reportedly exceeds that in Bakhmut and Mariupol in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Aleppo in the Battle of Aleppo, and Mosul and Raqqa in the War against the Islamic State; by 5 December 2023, the percentage of buildings damaged or destroyed in Gaza exceeded Dresden and Cologne during World War II and approached the level of destruction seen in Hamburg. Bombing has destroyed or damaged apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, religious sites, factories, and shopping centers. The Guardian reported that the scale of destruction has led international legal experts to raise the concept of domicide, which it describes as \"the mass destruction of dwellings to make [a] territory uninhabitable\". By 30 January 2024, satellite image analysis found Israel had destroyed 50-61% of the buildings in Gaza since the start of the war.",

This analysis focused on bombs weighing 2,000 pounds or more, which could irreparably damage a building 180 meters away. Israel has employed unguided munitions, which are particularly destructive, and has used artificial intelligence to quickly identify targets for bombing.",

They argue that these actions by Hamas constitute a significant violation of international law and were carried out with the intent to destroy the Israeli national group. Some commentators highlight Hamas's founding charter, which calls for the destruction of Israel; this has led to suggestions that its intent is genocidal and that the attacks on 7 October were an attempt to fulfill this agenda.",

The New York Times and the BBC reported that \"videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers\". Although not investigative in nature, a United Nations team concluded in March 2024 that there was \"clear and convincing information\" of Israeli hostages in Gaza experiencing \"sexual violence, including rape, sexualized torture, and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment\", and there was also \"reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence occurred during the 7 October attacks in multiple locations across Gaza periphery, including rape and gang-rape, in at least three locations\": the Nova music festival and its vicinities of Road 232 and kibbutz Re'im.",
        "Testimonies described the perpetrators using shovels, beheading victims, and even playing with severed body parts. Forensic examinations showed signs of sexual abuse, mutilations, broken limbs, and broken pelvises. In an interrogation of Hamas militants, one militant said they were given permission to perform necrophilia. These acts were denounced as gender-based violence, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, aligning with the International Criminal Court's recognition of sexual violence as such. Some of the released hostages also shared testimonies of sexual violence during their time in Gaza.",
        "A New York Times investigation by Jeffrey Gettleman, Anat Schwartz, and Adam Sella, released in late December 2023, found at least seven locations where sexual assaults and mutilations of Israeli women and girls were carried out. It concluded that these were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence during the 7 October massacres. The newspaper's probe concluded that Hamas \"weaponized sexual violence\" during the attacks. Nevertheless, the Schwartz later revealed that she did not find any victim or complaint of sexual assault when she contacted every rape crisis clinic in Israel. The Intercept and Mondoweiss both concluded that the mass rape allegations advanced by the New York Times were unfounded.",
        "Israel accused international women's rights and human rights groups of downplaying the assaults. Hamas denied that it committed any sexual assaults, and has called for an impartial international investigation into the accusations. On January 2024, UN experts Alice Jill Edwards and Morris Tidball-Binz[de] said in a statement that the sexual violence acts amounted to war crimes which \"may also qualify as crimes against humanity\".",
        "Human Rights Watch has stated that \"Hamas and Islamic Jihad are committing war crimes by holding scores of Israelis and others as hostages in Gaza\". They also added that \"Civilians, including children, people with disabilities, and older people, should never be treated as bargaining chips\", and \"The armed groups should immediately and safely release all civilians detained\". The secretary-general of Amnesty International urged the immediate release of \"all civilians who were abducted, including children\", and supported an investigation into these incidents \"as part of the International Criminal Court's ongoing investigation into crimes committed by all parties in the current conflict\".",
        "Israel has been accused of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza during the war. On 15 October, TWAILR published a statement signed by over 800 legal scholars expressing \"alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip\". On 17 October, Genocide Watch declared a \"Genocide Emergency Alert\" for the conflict in Gaza. Several scholars have cited numerous Israeli statements which they argue constitute an \"intent to destroy\" the population of Gaza, a necessary condition for the legal threshold of genocide to be met. On 16 November, OHCHR experts said that Israel's violations \"point to a genocide in the making\".",
        "On 29 December, South Africa submitted a case to the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza and requested provisional measures for Israel to suspend its military campaign in Gaza. In its filing, South Africa alleged that Israel's actions were \"intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group\". On 2 January 2024, Israel decided to appear before the ICJ in response to the case made by South Africa. The Court issued an Order in relation to the provisional measures request on 26 January 2024 in which it ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts that could be considered genocidal but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. It determined that it was \"plausible\" that some of Israel's actions may violate the Genocide Convention. The final ruling is expected to take years.",
        "Some researchers have alleged that destruction in Gaza amounts to \"domicide\".",
        "Israel imposed a \"complete siege\" on Gaza in the first ten days of the war, due to security concerns that weapons, fuel and armaments would be transferred to Hamas in the guise of humanitarian aid. Israel later allowed the delivery of limited humanitarian aid following security checks. Israel's restriction of the flow of food, fuel, water and other humanitarian aid was criticized as a war crime by human rights organizations.",
        "Tom Dannenbaum, co-director of the Center for International Law & Governance at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, wrote that the order \"commands the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime\". Oxfam issued a statement that accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war, saying \"International Humanitarian Law (IHL) strictly prohibits the use of starvation as a method of warfare and as the occupying power in Gaza, Israel is bound by IHL obligations to provide for the needs and protection of the population of Gaza\".",
        "Geoffrey S. Corn, Chair of Criminal Law and Director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, and Sean Watts, professor in the Department of Law at the United States Military Academy at West Point, write that sieges are subject to the same laws of war as other military tactics such as distinction and proportionality. Watts previously wrote that Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention \"requires that parties to a conflict allow passage of a limited class of relief supplies for civilians...only if the parties are satisfied no advantage will result 'to the military efforts or economy of the enemy'\", but that if the law is interpreted to allow \"incidental\" starvation of civilians proportional to anticipated military advantage, it \"reduces the rule's humanitarian effect, perhaps to the vanishing point\".",
        "Amnesty International called for an urgent investigation into Israel's mass detentions and the enforced disappearance of Palestinians in Gaza, noting that the disappearances and treatment of captives could amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity.",
        "Israel's adherence to the principles of discrimination and proportionality as required by the laws of war has been debated. Human Rights Watch has stated that the overall civilian death toll, and Israel's use of powerful weapons in Gaza's densely-populated neighbourhoods, raised \"serious questions\" about the legality of Israel's conduct. Human Rights Watch further argued that a higher proportion of casualties among women and children is indicative of a lack of proportionality, demonstrating what they describe as \"a disregard toward Palestinian lives\". Amnesty International accused Israel of war crimes in a report where it analyzed five incidents between 7 October and 12 October where the IDF targeted residential areas in Gaza. It found that in several cases the IDF struck targets with no evidence of military activity and that these attacks were \"indiscriminate\" in nature. Anonymous IDF officials cited in a report by +972 Magazine indicated a \"loosening of constraints\" in the rules of engagement, and that in numerous cases the IDF struck targets despite no evidence of military activity. The report claims that the rationale behind such attacks was \"to harm Palestinian civil society\" and, according to one source cited by the report, to \"lead civilians to put pressure on Hamas\". Experts cited by The Washington Post argue that certain Israeli airstrikes show that Israel has a tolerance for civilian casualties \"orders of magnitude greater\" than that of the US in its war against ISIS. United Nations officials and human rights groups have argued that Israel has not done enough to protect civilians.",
        "Emanuela-Chiara Gillard, an associate fellow at Chatham House, argued that, given the size and nature of the 7 October attacks, Israel has a right of self-defence that could include its stated military aim of destroying Hamas, which has threatened to repeat its assault and eradicate the state of Israel. According to The Economist, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and international humanitarian law (IHL) grant Israel flexibility when it comes to taking military action against Hamas, but in its view, Israel's \"definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point\".",
        "Amichai Cohen, an Israeli lawyer, alleges that Israel does not deliberately target civilians but that Hamas's tactics make it hard to take action without affecting civilians. Jill Goldenziel, a professor at the United States National Defense University and Marine Corps University, states that if Israel conducted every strike legally and with utmost precision, civilian casualties in war would still remain, and the goal of a proportionality analysis is to decide whether they are excessive. Israeli security officials state that their proportionality criteria in this conflict are unchanged and that they receive legal advice in relation to strikes. Other Israeli officials, speaking anonymously, acknowledged that Israel has struck \"private residences and public structures, like the Gaza Parliament and the Islamic University\", which would not previously have been considered valuable enough to justify the risk to civilian life.",
        "Independent United Nations experts condemned the Israel Defense Forces' actions in Gaza, saying Israel had resorted to \"indiscriminate military attacks\" and \"collective punishment\". Israeli authorities said that the airstrikes are intended to degrade the military infrastructure that is frequently constructed in close proximity to residential areas and civilian establishments. They also denounced the \"deliberate and widespread killing and hostage-taking of innocent civilians\" by Hamas, calling them \"heinous violations of international law and international crimes\". Israel's forced evacuation of northern Gaza also drew international condemnation. On 13 October, Paula Gaviria Betancur, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, called it a \"crime against humanity\". On 14 October, Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, characterized it as a \"repeat of the 1948 Nakba\", noting Israeli public officials' open advocacy for another Nakba. On 16 November, UN experts reported that \"grave violations\" committed by Israeli forces against the Palestinians of Gaza \"point to a genocide in the making\" and called on the international community to prevent this unfolding genocide. The OHCHR expressed concern regarding reports of \"mass detentions, ill-treatment and enforced disappearances of possibly thousands of Palestinians\" in the north of Gaza. On 23 February, the OHCHR stated that any transfer of weapons to Israel must be halted immediately as their use in Gaza is \"likely to violate international humanitarian law\".",
        "Over 100 landmarks have been destroyed or damaged by Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip according to a report by Heritage for Peace group. The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which was agreed to by both Palestinians and Israelis, protects sites of cultural heritage.",
        "The Great Mosque of Gaza was left with only the minaret standing while sites that have been damaged or destroyed include Rafah Museum[ar], Al Qarara Cultural Museum, Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, Hamam al-Sammara, and Tell el-Ajjul. The Church of Saint Porphyrius, the third oldest church in the world, was damaged in an airstrike, as has the Saint Hilarion Monastery. The Byzantine Church of Jabalia[ar], dating from the 5th century and restored in 2022, was destroyed. The destruction of Gaza City's public library and central archives have been compared to the 1992 attacks on the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All universities in the Gaza Strip were bombed by Israeli forces, including the destruction of Al-Israa University and its museum containing several thousand rare artefacts.",
        "By 20 January 2024, Israeli forces had desecrated at least sixteen cemeteries and had turned some into military outposts. Forensic Architecture noted that Israel had destroyed one of Gaza's most important archaeological sites, located near al-Shati refugee camp. Subsequent of destruction of a cemetery in Khan Unis, Israel said Hamas uses cemeteries to hide tunnels,sand that \"digging up the tunnels involves unavoidable collateral damage to sacrosanct spaces\". Israel also said it had damaged a cemetery in southern Gaza in a search for the bodies of hostages.",
        "United Nations experts urged an inquiry into serious human rights violations against Palestinian women and girls in Gaza and the West Bank by Israeli forces. The allegations involve rape and sexual violence. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement on 19 February, citing credible claims and referring to photos allegedly taken by Israeli troops showing female detainees in degrading circumstances posted online.",
        "Israeli soldiers posted videos of their looting Palestinian property on social media, with soldiers reporting that the practice was widespread and that commanders on the ground were largely allowing it to happen. The Military Advocate General wrote in a letter to IDF commanders that several incidents were under investigation, with some of the incidents potentially meriting criminal charges.",
        "On 24 October, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for a ceasefire. This was followed by a United Nations General Assembly vote for a resolution calling for an immediate truce. It received 121 votes in favor and 44 abstentions; 14 countries voted no.",
        "On 24 October, US President Joe Biden stated, \"We should have those hostages released and then we can talk\", and said that a ceasefire would allow Hamas to attack Israel again. On 2 November 2023, Hamas chairman Ismail Haniyeh stated that if Israel agreed to a ceasefire and the opening of humanitarian corridors to bring more aid into Gaza, Hamas is \"ready for political negotiations for a two-state solution with Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine\". This followed the 1 November statement by Hamas official Ghazi Hamad that Hamas would repeat the 7 October attack time and again until Israel is annihilated. On 3 November, Benjamin Netanyahu stated Israel would not agree to a ceasefire unless Hamas releases all hostages. On 6 November, both Israel and Hamas rejected calls for a ceasefire. On 15 November, Hamas official Izzat al-Risheq stated Israel was \"stalling to continue its aggression and war against defenceless civilians\".",
        "A truce was in place between 24 November and 1 December 2023, during which Hamas released hostages and Israel released prisoners.",
        "By 13 December 2023, Israel and the United States were becoming increasingly isolated amid growing global calls for a ceasefire. In December, new negotiations mediated by Egypt led to proposals of a multi-phase plan that would see the release of hostages, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and creation of a technocratic Palestinian government. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad rejected a permanent ceasefire offer which would have Hamas and the PIJ relinquish their control over Gaza and hold democratic elections.",
        "The ceasefire talks continued in Cairo in February and March 2024. The Israeli delegation said that the key issue was Hamas's refusal to hand over the list of hostages that are alive.",
        "The talks between Israel and Hamas on the release of hostages started almost immediately after the start of the war with Qatar and Egypt serving as mediators. The hostage negotiations were linked to ceasefire negotiations, with different factions in the Israeli government holding different positions.",
        "The Abducted and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli group representing the families of those taken hostage in Gaza, said that they supported a blanket release of all Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of all Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Yahya Sinwar, said the group was prepared to release all Israeli hostages in return for the release of all Palestinian prisoners. The IDF spokesman dismissed the report as \"psychological terror cynically used by Hamas to create pressure\".",
        "During the November 2023 prisoner exchange Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners and Hamas released 105 civilians.",
        "On 8 October, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) held a closed-door meeting for 90 minutes on the conflict. The meeting concluded without a joint statement being agreed. The Council passed a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause on 15 November. Israel's ambassador to the UN called the resolution \"disconnected from reality\", and stated that \"Israel will continue acting according to [international] law while the Hamas terrorists will not even read the resolution... let alone abide by it\". On 6 December, United Nations secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres invoked Article 99 of the Charter of the United Nations for the first time, which allows him to address matters that threaten \"international peace and security\" before the UN Security Council.",
        "Diplomats, concerned that Israel has no plan post war and looking to limit the humanitarian crisis as well as prevent any regional expansion of the war, are urging delay of a full-scale land invasion of Gaza. Russia requested a UNSC vote on 15 October on a draft resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire. The Russian draft was rejected while negotiations continued on a Brazilian draft resolution.",
        "On 18 October, the United States vetoed a UNSC resolution that \"condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, called for humanitarian pauses in all attacks to allow the delivery of lifesaving aid to civilians, and called for Israel to withdraw its directive for civilians to evacuate the northern part of the Gaza Strip\". The UNSC resolution, sponsored by Brazil and supported by 12 of the 15 Council members, calling for \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to Gazan civilians. The UK and Russia abstained. Louis Charbonneau at Human Rights Watch said the US had again \"cynically used their veto to prevent the UNSC from acting on Israel and Palestine at a time of unprecedented carnage\". The US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, explained that the US wanted more time to let American on-the-ground diplomacy \"play out\", and criticized the text for failing to mention Israel's right to self-defense, in line with the UN Charter \u2013 a point echoed by UK Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward. Subsequently, on 25 October, China and Russia vetoed a US drafted resolution and a Russian drafted resolution was vetoed by the UK and US. Hamas then issued a statement praising Russia and China's position and thanking all the countries who demanded an end to Israel's attacks on Gaza.",
        "On 15 November, the UNSC passed a resolution focusing on the humanitarian situation, calling for the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas and for urgent and extended humanitarian corridors throughout Gaza to save and protect civilian lives. Malta drafted the resolution; twelve members voted in favor, none against and three abstained. The United Kingdom and United States abstained, while they supported the emphasis on humanitarian relief, because it contained no explicit criticism of Hamas. Russia abstained because it did not call for an immediate ceasefire. The resolution followed four unsuccessful efforts the previous month, and a United Nations General Assembly Resolution calling for a cessation of hostilities on 27 October.",
        "World leaders, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and United Nations officials criticized the US for its veto on 8 December of a UNSC resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The UK abstained while the remaining 13 members of the council voted in favor. In response to the US veto, Egypt invoked Resolution 377A, which allows the UN General Assembly to address an issue threatening global security neglected by the UNSC.",

Bolivia's minister of the presidency demanded an end to the attacks on the Gaza Strip, while Chilean President Gabriel Boric cited Israel's \"collective punishment of the Palestinian civilian population\" and Columbian President Gustavo Petro cited the \"massacre of the Palestinian people\". Jordan's Foreign Minister cited an \"unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe\" and condemned the \"Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza\". Bahrain's National Assembly additionally cut off all economic relations, citing a \"solid and historical stance that supports the Palestinian cause and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people\". This decision does not appear to have been implemented. Honduras' Minister of Foreign Affairs cited Israel's violations of international humanitarian law. Turkey cited \"the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians, and Israel's refusal (to accept) a ceasefire\". Turkey was criticized for still maintaining economic and military relations with Israel. Chad cited the \"unprecedented tide of deadly violence\". South Africa recalled its entire diplomatic mission and criticized Israel's ambassador for disparaging those \"opposing the atrocities and genocide of the Israeli government\". Belize suspended diplomatic relations with Israel, citing the \"unceasing, indiscriminate bombing in Gaza\" and its violations of international humanitarian law.",

Both former president Donald Trump and Florida governor Ron DeSantis voiced their opposition to accepting any Palestinian refugees.",
        "Significant geopolitical divisions emerged. Much of the Western world provided \"strong\" support to Israel militarily and diplomatically, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany\nalthough the strong support is \"at odds with the attitudes of Western publics which continue to shift away from Israel\",\naccording to Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Lovatt says that during the Cold War, Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets, and western leaders generally see Israel \"as a fellow member of the liberal democratic club\" and that this partially \"explains the continued strong Western support for Israel \u2013 which has now largely become reflexive\". In contrast, the Islamic world and much of the Global South denounced the actions of Israel and its allies, criticizing the \"moral authority of the West\" and alleging that it holds double standards surrounding human rights. The double standards, in their view, is condemning an illegal occupation in Ukraine while standing firmly behind Israel that has occupied Palestinian lands.",

In contrast, 50.5% of Israeli Arabs believed that the Israeli military was using \"too much\" firepower in Gaza. According to a survey by the Israel Democracy Institute, only 10% of Israeli Jews would support a pause in the war in Gaza to allow an exchange of Israeli hostages. A public opinion poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 87% of Jewish Israelis supported the war in Gaza. 75% of Jewish Israelis rejected the Biden administration's calls to change the IDF's strategy to one that \"reduces the heavy bombing of densely populated areas.\"",
        "According to a survey carried out by the Hebrew University on 7\u20139 December on the post-war handling of Gaza, 56% of Israelis opposed the annexation of Gaza with 33% in favor. When questioned on who should administer Gaza in the immediate post-war period, 23% supported a coalition of moderate Arab states, 22% Israeli military rule, 18% an international force, 18% Israeli annexation and 11% the Palestinian Authority. The Direct Polls survey found that 83% of Israelis supported encouraging the voluntary emigration of residents of the Gaza Strip.

Prisoners have been subject to torture and at least four prisoners have died in Israeli custody. The ethics panel of the Knesset voted to suspend politician Ofer Cassif for 45 days over anti-Israel statements in interviews he made after the war broke out. Following a rally in support of Gaza in Haifa, police commissioner Kobi Shabtai threatened to send antiwar protesters to the Gaza Strip.

The statement said the unity government would not promote any policy or laws except those related to the ongoing fighting with Hamas. It significantly reduces the influence of Netanyahu's previous far-right coalition partners over the conduct of the war, which was one of Gantz's demands. Haaretz reported that former IDF chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer would join the war cabinet as observers.",

        "Prior to the war, Hamas was deeply unpopular in Gaza, with 52 percent of Palestinians stating they had no trust at all in the organization. Hamas was even more unpopular in the West Bank, with only around twelve percent support. During the war and Israel's bombardment of Gaza, Hamas's popularity among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank increased, while Palestinian support for peaceful coexistence with Israel declined significantly. According to a survey of 668 respondents carried out by Palestinian research firm AWRAD in the beginning of November 2023, 47 percent of Gazans strongly supported the 7 October attack. The overwhelming majority of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank said they would never forget or forgive Israel's behavior in Gaza during the war. Another survey released on 13 December found that 57% of respondents in the Gaza Strip and 82% in the West Bank believed Hamas was correct in launching the 7 October attack, while only 10% said they believed Hamas committed war crimes during the conflict. The survey also found that nearly 60% of respondents in the Palestinian Territories agreed with the dissolution of the Palestinian Authority, while 88% supported the resignation of president Mahmoud Abbas. In response to a critical social media video, Hamas issued a public statement warning against the publication of \"any pictures, videos or materials that are offensive to the image of the steadfastness and unity of our people in Gaza\".",
        "Among Gaza residents to criticize Hamas actions and their outcome, journalist Muhammad Mansour said: \"May Allah curse you, Hamas leadership. Sinwar, you are the offspring of a despicable creature. Allah will avenge the destruction you have inflicted upon us\". In early November, hundreds of people at a UN shelter in Gaza city shouted insults against Hamas and cried out that they wanted the war to end, in reaction to Hamas rocket launches at Israel. A spokesman for a Hamas ministry was interrupted during a televised speech by a man with a wounded hand shouting: \"May God hold you to account, Hamas!\" On Al-Jazeera an elderly woman complained that \"aid does not reach the nation and the entire people; Everything goes to their houses; They take it, they will even shoot me and do whatever they want to me, Hamas\"",
        "The Wall Street Journal reported on 21 December that since 7 October, \"quiet criticism has begun spreading\" against Hamas, with Gazans \"blaming the militants for having provoked Israel's wrath and for their inability to shield the population from a devastating war and a humanitarian crisis that deepens by the day\". The Journal said that such opposition was unlikely to break out into the open, but that the \"simmering opposition raises questions about the group's long-term hold over the strip\".",
        "Reactions in Gaza ranged from anger at the international community's tepid response to fear. The territory faced numerous major crises. The Israeli blockade caused significant difficulties, including a lack of food, medicine, and water. A pediatrics doctor at Kamal Edwan Hospital described the situation in Gaza as \"really dangerous\", stating that, as a result of Israel's denial of clean water, babies in his ward were experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Schools in the Gaza Strip were closed until further notice. Yahya al-Sarraj, the mayor of Gaza City, commented that the Israeli siege was a violation of international law and urged the international community to \"support the victims\".",
        "Initially, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asserted the Palestinians' right to self-defense against the \"terror of settlers and occupation troops\" and condemned the orders by Israel for residents to evacuate north Gaza, labeling it a \"second Nakba\". Later, Abbas rejected the killing of civilians on both sides, and said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinians.",
        "Following the attack, celebrations occurred in Nablus. France 24 reported \"Hamas called on \"resistance fighters in the West Bank\" to join the battle. Neighborhood watches were established in 50 locations amid fears of reprisals by Israeli settlers, while a general strike was called for 8 October. Seven Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli forces on 7 October, while 126 others were injured. As of 19 October, Al Jazeera reported that 76 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and Jerusalem, eight of them by armed Israeli settlers; the Palestinian Health Ministry said that 61 people have been killed and 1,250 injured in the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners Club said that 850 Palestinians, including lawmakers, prominent figures, journalists, and former detainees have been arrested by Israeli authorities since the start of the war.",
        "In contrast to previous Palestinian\u2013Israeli wars, as many Arab governments such as Egypt and Jordan had strongly negative views on Hamas, they restrained their official reactions to neutral press statements. Public reaction in the Arab world was much more positive towards Hamas, being strongly influenced by Hamas-produced social media videos that were viewed millions of times. The Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion, originally blamed on an Israeli airstrike, inflicted further damage on diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab states keen to avoid antagonizing their public.",
        "Whereas Al Jazeera, owned by the government of Qatar, gave airtime to Hamas officials, news channels in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, such as Al Arabiya and Sky News Arabia, interviewed mainly Arabic-speaking Jews. News anchors in these countries did not refer to the IDF as an \"occupation army\", and referred to Palestinian casualties as \"victims\" rather than \"martyrs\"; however, as the war progressed, these channels increasingly adopted an anti-Israel and pro-Hamas stance. Many in Lebanon, Syria and Egypt also fear that they may unwillingly be drawn into the conflict through the actions of Hezbollah and Iran. In Egypt, populist pro-government talk show hosts opined against Hamas, asking why Egyptians should suffer to help Palestinians. Egypt, despite having being pressed by the United States, refused to accept refugees from Gaza.",

In a speech on 3 November, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Americans had threatened to bomb Iran, and emphasized that Hezbollah had entered the war the day after Hamas's attack and that it would not stop its ongoing skirmishes with Israel. He stated that the United States was fully responsible for the current war against Gaza and its people, and that Israel was merely the \"instrument of execution\". He also said that anyone who wants to prevent a regional war must immediately stop the aggression against Gaza.",
        "Iran has praised the attack while being cautious to distance itself from its planning and execution. Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad told the BBC that Hamas had direct backing for the attack from Iran; European, Iranian and Syrian officers corroborated Iran's involvement, while senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mirdawi said the group planned the attacks on its own. The Israeli army and the United States say that there is no evidence that Iran is connected with the attack by Hamas. American intelligence appeared to show that Hamas's attack on Israel caught Iranian authorities by surprise.",
        "According to a report by Al-Monitor, since the start of the war between Israel and the Gaza militias, Iran has tried to show a face of disinterest in the spillover of the conflict, and on the other hand, it has pursued an active diplomatic campaign to isolate Israel. Supporting the cause of Palestine has been one of the ideological principles of Iran's Shia Islamic theocracy after the 1979 revolution, with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the first supreme leader of Iran, announcing the last Friday of every Ramadan as \"Quds Day\" and inviting all the Muslims of the world to express solidarity with the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Muslim people.",
        "The Iranian government opened an account for people to deliver charitable aid. It also opened a website and reported that more than six million volunteered to fight. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened that Islamic resistance was going to become unstoppable should the war continue. His spokesperson later said that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal would have delayed it but Israel would have collapsed within five years.\nKhamenei pointed to foreign visits to Israel and said that the fall of Israel was imminent.",
        "On 1 November, the Iranian government criminalized expressions of support for Israel and making contact with its people. That same day, Khamenei called on Muslim states to impose a food and fuel blockade on Israel.",
        "Khamenei however conveyed to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh that Iran would not directly intervene in the conflict with Israel, citing lack of prior warning about the 7 October attack. Despite this, Iran pledged to continue providing political and moral support to Hamas, urging restraint against calls for direct involvement by Iran and its ally Hezbollah. The IRGC's Quds Force promised it would continue supporting Hamas, while the IRGC's commander General Hossein Salami said that the war would bring about a political and economic decline of the US.",
        "Polling has indicated a divide between official government policy on the Israel\u2013Hamas war and the views of the general public. A November 2023 poll had 68% of Americans agreeing with a statement that \"Israel should call a ceasefire and try to negotiate\". 43% opposed military aid to Israel and 39% said that the U.S. should be a neutral mediator. A February 2024 Associated Press poll found that 44% saw Israel as \"a partner that the U.S. should cooperate with, but doesn't share its interests and values\", while 35% saw Israel \"as an ally that shares U.S. interests and values\". 50% of Americans believed Israel had \"gone too far\" in its response, 31% thought Israel had \"been about right\" and 15% thought Israel had \"not gone far enough\". Young Americans have been significantly less supportive of Israel than older generations. On 25 February 2024, Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, fatally self-immolated outside the front gate of the Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C. in protest of the ongoing US support of the war.",

Biden also called on Congress to pass $14.3billion in emergency military aid to Israel. Details of weapons sent to Israel, which have been arriving daily, have been kept secret. Leaked details have shown that the US has sent laser-guided missiles, 155mm shells, new army vehicles, among others, at Israel's request.",
        "The Pentagon said it would impose no limits on Israel's use of American weapons in the war. Foreign Policy reported on a \"groundswell of opposition\" among US diplomats and national security officials, against what they perceived as Biden's \"blank check\" for the Israeli counterattack. \"More than 630 employees\" of the US Agency for International Development signed a letter calling for an \"immediate ceasefire\".",
        "A significant proportion of the United States Navy, including the aircraft carriers USSGerald R. Ford and USSDwight D. Eisenhower, have been deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean, reportedly to deter other actors from entering the conflict. 2,000 troops were also prepared for possible deployment to Israel in mid-October. US officials said the Biden administration advised Israel to delay the ground invasion of the Gaza Strip to allow more time for hostage negotiations. President Biden said that attacks on Israel were intended in part to scuttle the potential normalization of the US ally's relations with Saudi Arabia. He mentioned that Hamas attacks aimed to halt Israel-Saudi Arabia agreement.",

The Jewish News Syndicate deemed it a \"failure of imagination\". A BBC report on the intelligence failure commented that \"it must have taken extraordinary levels of operational security by Hamas\". US officials expressed shock at how Israeli intelligence appeared to be unaware of any preparations by Hamas. Israeli officials later anonymously reported to Axios that the IDF and Shin Bet had detected abnormal movements by Hamas the day before the attack, but decided to wait for additional intelligence before raising the military's alert level.

He added that, viewed from Gaza, things were only going to get worse, considering that Netanyahu's coalition partners opposed a two-state solution for the conflict. He suggested they would prefer to annex the entirety of the West Bank, even at the expense of turning Israel into an apartheid state.",

The bank also stated that the estimate does not reflect total damage and did not include damages caused by the absence of Palestinian and foreign workers. In the final quarter of 2023, the Israeli economy shrank by 5.2% quarter-to-quarter due to labour shortages in construction and from the mobilization of 300,000 reservists. While Israel did still see economic growth of 2%, this was down from 6.5% growth in the year before the war. Further consequences of the war were that consumer spending declined 27%, imports declined by 42% and exports were reported to decline by 18%.",

    "2023 Herat earthquakes": [
        "Four large earthquakes measuring Mww 6.3 each and their aftershocks affected Herat Province in western Afghanistan in early October 2023. The first two earthquakes occurred on 7 October at 11:11 AFT and 11:42 AFT near the city of Herat, followed by many aftershocks. On 11 and 15 October, two other magnitude 6.3 earthquakes struck the same area. Thrust faulting was associated with these earthquakes. The World Health Organization estimated 1,482 fatalities, 2,100 injuries, 43,400  people affected and 114,000 people requiring humanitarian aid. The 11, 15 and 28 October earthquakes caused a combined seven deaths and 344 injuries.",
        "The earthquakes struck Afghanistan during an ongoing humanitarian crisis following the Taliban takeover in 2021, and existing aid groups were experiencing a lack of funds prior to the disaster. Some aid agencies including UNICEF and the Red Cross appealed for donations in response to the earthquakes. Many international organizations and countries participated in rescue and relief efforts. Hospitals were overwhelmed by the number of injured and lack of proper equipment. Additional thousands were made homeless as the country enters the winter.",
        "Afghanistan is situated within the broad and complex zone of collision between the Arabian Plate, the Indian Plate, and the Eurasian Plate. The western part of the country is subdivided into the North Afghan Platform to the north and a series of accreted terranes to the south. The North Afghan Platform has remained relatively tectonically stable since the Variscan Orogeny during the Late Palaeozoic, when it became part of Eurasia. To the south there is a collage of continental fragments and magmatic arcs that have been progressively accreted, particularly in the Mesozoic era. The boundary between these two crustal areas is the major right-lateral strike-slip Harirud (or Herat) Fault, which is far less seismically active than the Chaman Fault that runs through the east of the country. To the north of the Harirud Fault, the near parallel Band-e Turkestan Fault does show signs of recent activity, also in a right-lateral sense.",
        "The seismicity of Afghanistan is attributed to the complex and active tectonic interactions between the Arabian, Eurasian, and Indian plates. Within 250km (160mi) of the 7 October earthquakes epicenters, there have been seven magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquakes with epicenters in Iran. These include a Mw\u202f 7.3 earthquake in May 1997 and a Mw\u202f 7.1 earthquake in 1979. In June 2022, eastern Afghanistan was affected by an earthquake that killed over 1,000 people.",
        "The first event, measuring a magnitude of 6.3, struck at 11:11 AFT (06:41 UTC). A magnitude 5.5 aftershock occurred eight minutes later. Another magnitude 6.3 event struck at 11:42 AFT (07:12 UTC), followed by a magnitude 5.9 aftershock. On 11 October, a third Mww\u202f 6.3 earthquake occurred within the same area and another event of the same magnitude occurring on 15 October. While the United States Geological Survey estimated the fourth event had a magnitude of Mww\u202f6.3. The United States Geological Survey said all four earthquakes were the result of shallow thrust faulting. The fault plane solution indicate a rupture source striking east\u2013west with a north or south dip.  On October 28, a Mww\u202f5.0 event hit the area, followed by a mb\u202f4.8 aftershock the next day.",
        "According to seismologists, these earthquakes had epicenters between the Siakhubulak Fault in the north and Herat Fault in the south. According to satellite data from Sentinel-1A, an area measuring 30km (19mi) by 15km (9.3mi) and extending east\u2013west around the location of these earthquakes was uplifted. Meanwhile the satellite detected subsidence in a small area east of the uplifted zone. The seismologists added that the ground deformation was diffuse and inferred the earthquakes were associated with a blind thrust fault. The fault responsible is likely a structure located between the Herat and Siakhubulak faults.",
        "Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology released two possible finite fault models for the second large earthquake. In both models, no slip occurred at the top depth of the model. The first model is a north-dipping, east-southeast\u2013west-northwest striking thrust fault. The rupture mechanism was reverse-faulting with a small right-lateral component, initiating at a depth of 5.0km (3.1mi). In this model, the maximum slip was 2.2m (7ft 3in) at 4.8km (3.0mi) depth and immediately east of the hypocenter. Slip of 1m (3ft 3in) or greater was observed east and west of the hypocenter although the largest slip (>2m (6ft 7in)) was observed to the east.",
        "In the latter model, the fault dips to the south and strikes east\u2013west. The focal depth is inferred to be 5.8km (3.6mi); the zone of maximum slip is located east of the hypocenter, where it peaked at 2.8m (9ft 2in). Overall, to the immediate east and west of the hypocenter, the slip was about 2m (6ft 7in) although the larger values were observed further away.",
        "The World Health Organization reported 1,482 deaths as of 19 October while Taliban officials said about 1,000 had died. The Taliban revised the death toll on 11 October from a previous estimate of over 3,000. They added that confusion arose as rescue groups had counted twice and there were coordination issues. The World Health Organization said 90 percent of the casualties were women and children who died in their homes when they collapsed. At the time of the earthquakes, most men were outdoors, the organization added. The World Health Organization recorded 2,100 wounded while the Taliban provided an estimate of 2,400 people injured.",
        "The United Nations also estimated 43,300 people affected and 114,000 people in need of aid. Among the villages affected were Mahal Wadakah, where 20 people died, Dasht Hows, Bahadorzai, and Zoryan. Telephone communications were also lost. In addition to the destruction in Herat Province, collapsed houses and injuries were also reported in the neighbouring provinces of Badghis and Farah.",
        "Over 21,500 houses were destroyed, and 17,088 others were severely damaged. At least 21,300 buildings, including 21 health facilities and 21 schools also received damage. Homes constructed of mud constituted the hardest-hit settlements; a resident of one of the affected areas said many homes collapsed during the first earthquake. An official representing the National Disaster Management Authority said in several villages with populations of 1,000, only 100 out of an estimated 300 houses remained intact.",
        "Over 15 villages were destroyed, three others were severely damaged and 38 were moderately affected. The village of Nayeb Rafi was completely razed and nearly 80 percent of its population perished. In Siah Aab, Zinda Jan District, 300 inhabitants perished. In the Kushk District, more than 200 houses were damaged or destroyed to some extent. Entire families, including some with 30 members, were reportedly trapped under the rubble. In the village of Sarboland, dozens of houses were levelled and a resident said at least 30 people died. Up to 170 people were reported to have died in the village of Kashkak. Hundreds of people remained trapped beneath collapsed ruins, said a government official on 8 October.",
        "Medieval-era minarets in Herat also sustained damage. Plaster from walls fell while parts of buildings collapsed in the city. In Iran, one person in Torbat-e Jam was injured and minor damage to houses occurred in Taybad.",
        "The 11 October earthquake killed three people and injured at least 169. Of the injured, 153 were in Herat, 13 were from Badghis, and three were from Farah provinces. Many people were living outdoors because of damage to homes from the first two quakes when the third earthquake struck in the early morning. The governor's office in Herat said several neighbouring districts that were badly affected by previous earthquakes had experienced \"huge losses\" following the 11 October shock. This earthquake destroyed all 700 houses in Chahak, a village undamaged by the previous earthquakes. The Herat\u2013Torghundi highway was blocked by a landslide. In Herat, damage was limited; bricks from the Akhtaruddin Castle collapsed and parts of its walls fractured. Several minarets also collapsed. Parts of rooftop of the Great Mosque of Herat fell and scattered debris into the floor; the Herat Citadel was also damaged.",
        "The earthquake on 15 October caused four deaths, 160 injuries and additional damage in the eastern districts of Herat city. Several villages were completely destroyed and power outages occurred in most of Herat Province. Two people were also injured in Torbat-e Jam, Iran. The 28 October earthquake injured 13 people and caused additional property damage in Herat.",
        "The earthquakes occurred at a time when the region was struggling to cope with multiple crises such as displacement caused by decades of war, a years-long drought, and a huge reduction in foreign aid since the Taliban takeover in 2021.",
        "The World Health Organization dispatched 12 ambulances to Zinda Jan District to transport casualties to hospitals. The United Nations dispatched four ambulances carrying doctors and psychosocial support counsellors to a hospital. The Associated Press reported on 9 October that three mobile health teams were expected to be in Zinda Jan District. Five medical tents designed to assist 80 patients were established by Doctors Without Borders at Herat Regional Hospital. Seven teams of the Afghan Red Crescent Society were involved in rescue efforts while more teams were expected to arrive from eight other provinces. A spokesman for the organization said people made homeless were residing at a temporary shelter. The organization also provided tarpaulins, water storage containers, kitchen appliances, blankets and many other essentials. UNICEF distributed 10,000 hygiene kits, 5,000 family kits, 1,500 sets of winter clothes and blankets, 1,000 tarpaulins, and basic household items to the area.",
        "The national director of World Vision Afghanistan said on 9 October that \"the situation is worse than we imagined\", adding that people were still attempting to rescue those trapped under debris with their hands. Communication outage and blocked roads hampered rescue missions. In affected villages, residents used shovels and their bare hands to retrieve survivors beneath the rubble. An Afghan police spokesperson said on 8 October that the affected people required food and shelter. Personnel from the military and nonprofit organizations such as the Red Crescent also participated in rescue missions. The World Food Program said their workers were distributing food packages. Food packages were ready for 20,000 people; each package sufficient to sustain a family of seven for a month. The organization was also preparing to provide food support for up to 70,000 people. Athlete Rashid Khan pledged his Cricket World Cup fees to help victims of the earthquake and announced that a fundraising campaign would be set up.",
        "A provincial health department official said over 200 bodies were transported to hospitals and many of the dead were women and children. The main hospital of Herat prepared for the large inflow of victims by lining-up beds outside. At Herat Hospital, a health worker said vans carrying bodies were arriving every minute. Many health workers at the hospital were overwhelmed at the number of injured and the morgue had been overrun. The Taliban governor's office in Kandahar said 10 teams including 37 doctors and nurses were sent to Herat Province. Kandahar's public health director said the teams were also transporting 2 tons of medicine.",
        "By 10 October, approximately 72 hours after the first two earthquakes, rescue efforts had subsided; however, rescue and relief teams were active again following the third earthquake on 11 October. Health teams transferred several of the wounded to a hospital. According to the Afghan Red Crescent on 12 October, search and rescue efforts were 98 percent completed. However in the affected area, 32 health and rescue groups would remain in the area. There were no announcements from the Taliban about officially ending all rescue efforts. Following the 15 October earthquake, three damage assessment teams were dispatched by Iran to Razavi and South Khorasan provinces. Iran also sent a damage assessment team to Torbat-e Jam.",
        "Mass funerals were held in the affected villages. Three hundred people were given a mass funeral and burial in Siah Ab. More than 35 rescue teams from military and nonprofit organizations had been deployed. On 13 October, the Supreme Court of Afghanistan ordered the release of 473 prisoners from a prison facility in Herat Province due to fears that it may collapse after cracks were found in its walls during a two-day damage inspection. All prisoners were released by the same day on compassionate grounds and because they had served most of their sentence.",
        "About 2,100 displaced people fled to Herat. People with relatives or homes in other provinces evacuated Herat after the 15 October earthquake. Due to aftershocks, many survivors did not sleep in their homes. The World Health Organization said these aftershocks had left survivors \"in a persistent state of anxiety and fear\". Many homes, offices and mosques were abandoned as residents were living in temporary tents. Many traumatized and anxious people visited hospitals for assistance. The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Herat Province became a \u201ctent city\u201d as people took refuge under tents in parks and open spaces. In January 2024, Fran Equiza, the UNICEF representative in Afghanistan, said that almost 100,000 children in the affected areas remained in urgent need of humanitarian aid.",
        "Many hospitals in Herat became overwhelmed by patients. At the Herat Regional Hospital, there were support teams from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Although most patients did not have life-threatening injuries, many remained at the hospital because their homes were uninhabitable. Afghanistan was also entering the winter season while thousands of people remained homeless admist cold temperatures. Doctors Without Borders stated that more than 340 people were discharged from a hospital but refused to leave as they had no homes. By 12 October, the World Health Organization had treated over 5,600 individuals; many were from Zendeh Jan District. Strong winds occurred across the country beginning on 12 October, damaging tents and injuring additional people.",
        "Abdul Ghani Baradar, Afghanistan's Deputy Prime Minister of Economic Affairs, visited the affected area and met locals, officials and health workers. During the visit, he also announced the Taliban would construct new houses for survivors. The Taliban announced they plan to provide housing for survivors before the winter.",
        "By January 2024, at least 3,000 houses had been constructed in Zinda Jan, while the reconstruction efforts saw the usage of superadobe housing in Afghanistan for the first time. However, Luo Dapeng, the representative of the World Health Organization in Afghanistan, estimated that between 200,000 to 300,000 people were still living in tents following the earthquake.",
        "The Taliban publicly appealed for aid; at a news conference on 8 October, they said all international and internal organizations support was needed. Besides many countries offering aid, many international organizations also contributed to the humanitarian response. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said requested immediate assistance and said on 12 October, only 36 percent of its US$132.64million appeal was collected. A separate fundraising for US$20million was also organized by UNICEF. Nevertheless, the international response to the earthquake was seen as slow due to many countries' reluctance to interact with the Taliban-led government and the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas War, which began hours before the first mainshock happened on 7 October. In February 2024, the UN estimated that around $400 million was needed for reconstruction and recovery efforts from the disaster."

    "Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion": [
        "On 17 October 2023, an explosion took place in the parking lot of the courtyard of al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City during the Israel\u2013Hamas war, resulting in a large number of fatalities and injuries among displaced Palestinians seeking shelter there.",
        "Reports of the number of fatalities vary widely. The Gaza Health Ministry reported 342 injured and 471 killed. The Anglican diocese that manages the hospital reported 200 people killed. US intelligence agencies assessed a death toll between 100 and 300. A report by Human Rights Watch also questioned the Health Ministry's casualty figures. The cause of the explosion is contested. Israel, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada said that their intelligence sources indicate the cause of the explosion was a failed rocket launch from within Gaza by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Hamas and PIJ stated the explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike.",
        "The consensus from various independent studies of videos, images, and eyewitness reports of the explosion, its aftermath, and the blast area suggests that an errant rocket launch from within Gaza is the most probable cause. While this is not a conclusive finding, it is currently considered the likeliest explanation based on the evidence gathered in investigations conducted by the Associated Press, CNN, The Economist, The Guardian, and The Wall Street Journal. Human Rights Watch stated that the available evidence made an Israeli airstrike \"highly unlikely\".",
        "The Al-Ahli Arab Hospital is an 80-bed hospital in Gaza City. It was run by the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention between 1954 and 1982, and is still known as the Baptist Hospital (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646\u064a) despite currently being under Anglican management. The Anglican Archbishop of Jerusalem described the cancer treatment centre as the \"Crown Jewel of Ahli Hospital\" that had provided cancer diagnoses as a prelude to treatment options at Ahli and other hospitals.",
        "The World Health Organization indicated that there were 51 attacks on health facilities in Gaza between 7 and 17 October 2023, killing 15 hospital workers and injuring 27 others.",
        "Before the explosion, there was also a history of Palestinian militant groups firing rockets from within the Gaza Strip that fell short of their target, resulting in property damage and casualties. According to Human Rights Watch, armed Palestinian groups had unlawfully launched thousands of rockets towards Israel since 7 October. The IDF said that in the 11 days preceding the explosion at the Al-Ahli Hospital, 450 rockets fired by Palestinian militant organizations landed inside Gaza. The rockets used by Palestinian groups have only basic guidance capabilities and thus have high misfire rates.",
        "Human Rights Watch noted that Israel and Palestinian armed groups both have demonstrated a longstanding failure to impartially and credibly investigate violations of international humanitarian law.",
        "On Saturday 14 October, according to a statement by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, an Israeli rocket had damaged the upper two floors of the hospital's cancer treatment center, which contained the ultrasound and mammography wards, and injured four staff members. The Washington Post, Le Monde, and Human Rights Watch reported that the munition on 14 October was likely an illumination shell.",
        "The Washington Post reported that an Anglican pastor working for the diocese had filmed a video of a shell in the hospital's ultrasound room and that the video showed a 155mm artillery illumination shell. The report said, \"[i]llumination rounds are not fired directly at targets and descend on a parachute to signal, illuminate areas or mark targets, while the body of the shell falls from the sky\". An Israeli military spokesman said, \"If an artillery round landed there, then it was probably a result of it falling or landing after having been fired, but definitely not targeting the hospital.\"",
        "Le Monde published an article containing an analysis of a photo shared on social media depicting the damage from 14 October and the remnant of a shell. According to several experts consulted by Le Monde, the photo shows a 155 mm caliber shell. Richard Stevens, of the CAT-UXO collective, a specialist in collating information about explosive devices, told Le Monde that the color of the shell was consistent with an illumination projectile.",
        "The Human Rights Watch report published on 26 November 2023 noted that the damage resulting from the 14 October incident appeared kinetic and not explosive, and that an illumination flare was visible in social media posts depicting the event.",
        "On Friday 13 October, Israel ordered hospitals and the population of northern Gaza to evacuate to southern Gaza. Because of insufficient beds in the southern Gaza Strip and no means of transporting patients, such as newborns in incubators or patients on ventilators, the evacuation orders were widely regarded as impossible to comply with.",
        "The Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem stated the hospital had received at least three evacuation warnings from the Israeli military on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Human Rights Watch reported that all hospitals in northern Gaza\u2013not just al-Ahli\u2013received general evacuation orders on 13 October and the days after. On Saturday 14 October, the World Health Organization issued a statement, \"Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals in northern Gaza are a death sentence for the sick and injured\". In his statement on Sunday 15 October 2023 Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby said, \"The seriously ill and injured patients at the Anglican-run Ahli Hospital\u2013 and other healthcare facilities in northern Gaza\u2013 cannot be safely evacuated.\"",
        "An estimated 400 to 500 displaced Gazans were sheltering on hospital grounds from the ongoing Israel\u2013Hamas war. Throughout the day, Hamas published numerous posts on its Telegram channels, providing updates on rocket attacks aimed at Israeli territory.",
        "The explosion occurred in a parking lot in the courtyard at 6:59 p.m. local time on Tuesday 17 October, creating orange plumes in the sky. A video captured the explosion's first sounds, described as a \"whirring noise.\" Local reports of the explosion were made between 7 p.m. and 7:20 p.m.",
        "The explosion did not cause significant damage to surrounding buildings. Scorch marks and fire-damaged vehicles, including one vehicle that was flipped over, were observed in the parking lot at the explosion site the following day. A crater at the impact site was described as \"fairly shallow\". French intelligence assessed the crater to be about 1m (3.3ft) long, 75cm (2.46ft) across, and 30cm (0.98ft) to 40cm (1.3ft) deep. According to CNN, the impact crater was approximately 3ft (91cm) by 3 ft wide, and 1ft (30cm) deep.",
        "Ghassan Abu-Sittah, of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, said that the ceiling of the operating room collapsed.",
        "The cause of the explosion has not been confirmed. Early efforts to analyse the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion were quickly complicated by a variety of claims and counterclaims over who was responsible, as well as the rapid spread of unverified, misleading and false information on social media. An independent analysis by Human Rights Watch concluded that the cause of the explosion was a misfired Palestinian rocket.",
        "The number of persons killed in the explosion has not been independently verified. As of 19 October 2023, the death toll reported by the Hamas-led Gaza Health Ministry was 471, revised from their initial estimate of 500. The board chair of the American Friends of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem told a local ABC News station that the organization believes approximately 200 people died in the explosion. As of 19 October 2023, US intelligence agencies had assessed that the blast killed 100 to 300 people, and that the actual number was likely on the low end of that range. Human Rights Watch stated that the numbers put out by the Gaza Health Ministry, if true, would represent an unusually high death-to-injury ratio (471 killed vs. 342 injured) and would appear out of proportion with the damage observed at the explosion site.",
        "Mohammed Abu Selmia, director of the nearby al-Shifa Hospital, estimated a death toll of 250 and reported that around 350 injured people were brought to his hospital by both ambulances and personal cars. He said the terrible condition of many bodies made it difficult to arrive at a total number of dead.",
        "IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari criticized media outlets for quickly disseminating what he termed as \"unverified claims\" by Hamas regarding the death toll, saying it was implausible for Hamas to accurately determine the casualty figures so soon after the incident.",
        "Hamas declined to disclose any information about the identity of the deceased to The New York Times.",
        "The explosion resulted in massive protests in the West Bank, Iran, Canada, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Yemen. In Ramallah and other cities in the West Bank, protestors chanted against Mahmoud Abbas and threw stones, leading to police using tear gas and stun grenades in an attempt to disperse protestors. Thousands of protestors marched outside the Israeli Consulate in Istanbul to protest against the war, and in Jordan, protestors attempted to storm the Israeli embassy. The US and French embassies in Beirut also faced protests aimed at their support for Israel.",
        "Jordan canceled a quadrilateral summit that had been scheduled to take place between Jordanian King Abdullah II, President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and US President Joe Biden, after Abbas withdrew from it in protest of the explosion.",
        "News coverage of the event changed quickly, with conflicting reports from Gazan, Israeli and American sources. The Guardian initially reported that \"the scale of the blast appeared to be outside either of the militant groups' capabilities.\" BBC correspondent Jon Donnison told BBC News viewers on the evening of the explosion: \"It's hard to see what else this could be, really, given the size of the explosion, other than an Israeli air strike, or several air strikes\", adding, \"When we've seen rockets being fired out of Gaza, we never see explosions of that scale.\" Days later, BBC's deputy director of news Jonathan Munro said that the corporation had made a mistake in its live coverage, and that Donnison \"was wrong to speculate about the cause of the explosion of the hospital.\" BBC also issued a clarification and apology on 23 October, writing: \"We accept that even in this fast-moving situation it was wrong to speculate in this way about the possible causes and we apologise for this, although he did not at any point report that it was an Israeli strike.\"",
        "After the explosion on 17 October, the New York Times' home page prominently featured headlines highlighting the Palestinian claims about an \"Israeli Strike\" and \"At Least 500 Dead\", before starting to tone them down and include Israeli counter-claims after about two hours (according to an analysis by Nieman Lab). Several New York Times journalists had raised concerns about these headlines internally, but they were overruled. On 23 October 2023, The New York Times published an Editors' Note (which Nieman Lab summarized as \"a limited mea culpa\") indicating that its early coverage of the event \"relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified\" and stated that \"Times editors should have taken more care with the initial presentation, and been more explicit about what information could be verified.\"",
        "On 25 October 2023, Le Monde published an explanation stating that they \"were not cautious enough\" in their initial coverage, which suggested that the Israeli army was responsible for the explosion and was not explicit in disclosing that the health ministry in the Gaza Strip is \"administered by Hamas.\" The explanation noted that the inability to verify information because of the Israeli army's ban on press access to Gaza made cautious coverage especially important, and pledged to \"regularly remind [its] readers that some news coming out of the Gaza Strip, in particular casualty figures, cannot be verified\" and to clarify Hamas's control over the health ministry.",
        "The BBC noted on 26 October 2023 that the analyses since the explosion have focused on three main areas: the absence of any fragments from the munition, the crater and damage caused by the explosion, and images showing \"a projectile rising over Gaza.\" To conduct a full investigation would require independent access to the site, inspection of any physical evidence, and the ability to interview witnesses\u2013none of which has been possible because of the state of the ongoing war.",
        "According to the video analysis of The Wall Street Journal, a long-range rocket was launched from Gaza in a northeastern direction toward Israel. Ten seconds after the rocket was launched, it malfunctioned and veered back toward the west, with the hospital in its path. The Wall Street Journal's analysis also concluded that the impact crater was consistent with a rocket fragment incoming from the east.",
        "On 20 October 2023, the Associated Press (AP) reported that it concluded from analyzing \"more than a dozen videos from the moments before, during and after the hospital explosion, as well as satellite imagery and photos\" that \"the rocket that broke up in the air was fired from within Palestinian territory, and that the hospital explosion was most likely caused when part of that rocket crashed to the ground\", while acknowledging the unavailability of definitive proof. AP reported that its preliminary conclusion was supported by experts in open-source intelligence, geolocation, and rocketry, \"who all agreed the most likely scenario was a rocket from within Gaza that veered off and came apart seconds before the explosion.\" Andrea Richardson, an experienced war crimes investigator, told AP: \"From the video evidence that I have seen, it's very clear that the rockets came from within Gaza.\" Justin Crump, an intelligence consultant, said: \"You can see obviously it fails in flight, it spins out and disintegrates, and the impacts on the ground follow that.\" Henry Schlottman, another intelligence expert, indicated that the most likely scenario based on available video evidence is that a rocket was launched within Gaza, failed mid-air, and accidentally struck the hospital.",
        "Channel 4 News said that the trajectory of the missile that appeared on Al Jazeera Live is inconsistent with the missile launching location stated by the IDF and noted a contradiction in IDF statements on the location of the launching site of the alleged Palestinian missile that hit the hospital in their presentation. Channel 4 News also used Doppler effect sound analysis of the strike and visual analysis of the crater created by the strike. Both analyses indicated that the object that caused the blast would have come from points \"east of the hospital not west as the IDF claimed.\" Channel 4 also reported that Hamas and Islamic Jihad had not backed their claims of Israeli origin with evidence and that \"Islamic Jihad claimed to have a missile fragment but have not produced it\". The New York Times, Bloomberg News, Al Jazeera, BBC News, and El Pa\u00eds cited a tweet by Forensic Architecture, which the Times describes as critical of Israel, in which they disputed Israel's account that the blast was caused by a rocket from Gaza and instead was the result of a missile fired from the direction of Israel.",
        "CNN consulted a leading American acoustic expert who spoke anonymously due to a lack of permission to speak publicly from the expert's university. The acoustic expert analyzed the sound waveform and concluded that although the changes in frequency indicated the projectile was in motion, no information could be gleaned regarding the direction of the motion. CNN also reported that the dark scorch marks on the \"dark patches on the ground fanning out in a southwesterly direction from the crater,\" and burnt trees and a knocked-over lamppost behind the crater were consistent with a rocket approaching from the southwest. CNN noted that, if the projectile were an artillery munition, this could indicate a trajectory from the northeast, but the direction on impact would be inconclusive if the projectile malfunctioned and broke apart in the air. Markus Schiller, a missile expert who has provided analyses for NATO and the European Union, told CNN that he believed a malfunctioning rocket \"fell apart mid-air\" and crashed into the car park. He also said that it was not possible for him to confirm it with the \"usual analysis drawing on altitude, flight path and the burn time\" because it is not possible to predict the flight path and behavior of a malfunctioning rocket.",
        "The New York Times published an analysis on 24 October 2023 casting doubt on the theory that the rocket seen in the Al Jazeera video had caused the explosion at the hospital. According to their analysis, some 25 seconds elapsed between the firing of the last Palestinian missile towards Israel and the explosion at the hospital. The Al Jazeera footage cited by the IDF as depicting a rocket aimed at Israel that exploded close to the time of the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital blast showed instead, the Times said, a rocket fired from an Israeli position near Nahal Oz that exploded on the border at a distance of some two miles from the hospital, making it unrelated to the blast. The Times  analysis concluded that while responsibility for the hospital blast is unknown, the contention by Israeli and American intelligence agencies that a failed Palestinian rocket launch might have been to blame remains plausible. However, they added, \"The Times analysis does cast doubt on one of the most-publicized pieces of evidence that Israeli officials have used to make their case and complicates the straightforward narrative they have put forth.\" In addition, the videos analyzed by the Times showed two things: firstly, that militants were firing dozens of rockets from southwest of the hospital, so a failed rocket falling well short of its target with unspent fuel might have caused the fiery explosion, and secondly, that there appears to have been Israeli bombardment in the area, with two explosions visible near the hospital within two minutes of it being struck. Israeli forces told The Times that they had not been striking \"within a range that endangered the hospital,\" but did not indicate how close the nearest strike had been.",
        "The Washington Post published a similar analysis on 26 October 2023, which also concluded that the projectile shown in the videos is not the same projectile that caused the explosion at the hospital. Instead, The Washington Post concluded that the projectile seen in the videos appeared to be an Israeli missile intercepting a rocket over Israeli territory about three miles from the hospital.",
        "Le Monde's analysis on 3 November 2023 also concluded that the projectile shown in the Al Jazeera broadcast was probably unrelated to the explosion at the hospital, noting that the projectile shown appeared to have exploded at such an altitude and distance from the hospital that it was unlikely that debris could have reached the hospital in the 20 seconds between the projectile exploding midair and the explosion at the hospital.",
        "In the report on its findings published on 26 November 2023, Human Rights Watch reached the same conclusion as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Le Monde, namely, that the projectile shown in the Al Jazeera live stream video appears to be an Iron Dome missile intercepting a rocket over Israeli territory at a location that is too far away from the hospital to have caused the explosion.",
        "The Washington Post consulted over two dozen munitions experts, all of whom agreed that the impact of the explosion was inconsistent with an airstrike, which would have caused greater destruction, or an artillery strike, \"which would have left substantial fragments and probably not caused the massive fireball seen in videos.\"\nBBC Verify spoke to a number of experts to establish whether publicly available evidence could establish the cause of the explosion. Some experts said they could not form a view on what occurred, while three experts said that the evidence was inconsistent with an Israeli airstrike or warhead damage, and that evidence was consistent with an explosion caused by rocket fuel. Security experts said that the preliminary evidence suggests that a Palestinian rocket fired inside Gaza caused the explosion.",
        "Justin Bronk at Royal United Services Institute said that, while not conclusive, \"a rocket failure causing an explosion and fuel fire\" was a more likely explanation than an Israeli airstrike. Independent open-source intelligence (OSINT) groups and analysts interviewed by The Telegraph, including Evan Hill, an OSINT investigator for The Washington Post, as well as The Independent, agreed. The Wall Street Journal reported that analysts who examined publicly available images said the explosion site did not \"bear the hallmarks of a strike with a bomb or missile of the types used by Israel\" and that the \"damage appeared more consistent with a fireball from a rocket.\"",
        "The Guardian quoted Marc Garlasco as saying that the crater at the blast site required kinetic energy inconsistent with a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) aerial bomb, and was also inconsistent with an airstrike, concluding that it was \"more likely to be a weapon that failed and released its payload over a wide area.\" In an interview with PBS, Garlasco also referred to an unusual amount of fire damage, pointing to a long period of burn which, according to him, is also inconsistent with the way standard military munitions work. Bellingcat noted that one of the images the IDF spokesman used to demonstrate there was no crater did in fact show what appeared to be a crater, and also quoted Garlasco's analysis. They requested comments and the next day IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus stated that the size of the crater and the damage caused were too small for the munitions used by the IDF, as previously stated: \"Scroll through pictures of rockets that impacted in Sderot, Ashkelon, in Be'er-Sheva, you'll see very similar sites,\" he said. \"A small crater, lots of soot and fire remarks and you can see that all of the buildings around are generally intact.\" NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, also told the BBC that the crater observed at the hospital was significantly smaller than what would typically result from a 155 mm artillery projectile. On the other hand, Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that he was unable to conclude from the available evidence whether the crater may have been caused by an artillery shell, a mortar, or a rocket. Human Rights Watch determined that the sound audible in the video recorded by a bystander and was consistent with a motor-propelled munition, such as a rocket or missile, and inconsistent with an artillery shell. Additionally, Human Rights Watch said that the impact crater lacked any indication that the projectile was spin-stabilized, as would be an artillery shell launched at an angle of less than 45 degrees.",
        "Two researchers from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute noted that the blast radius and lack of structural damage on the surrounding cars were inconsistent with a typical Israeli airstrike.",
        "The Associated Press noted the absence of any large crater of the sort that would be expected if the explosion were caused by an Israeli airstrike. Although Israel does have smaller munitions in its arsenal, the AP noted that \"there has been no public evidence of such missile strikes in the area around the al-Ahli Arab Hospital on Tuesday night.\"  AP reported that David Shank, a retired US Army colonel with expertise in military rockets and missiles, explained that the large explosion and subsequent fire was likely caused by the fact that the rocket was still full of propellant. A later analysis by the AP, including video evidence and satellite imagery, as well as expert opinion, assessed that a rocket was fired from Gaza, and that \"the hospital explosion was most likely caused when part of that rocket crashed to the ground\", though the lack of physical evidence makes definitive proof unlikely if not impossible.",
        "Der Spiegel reported that the opinion of Fabian Hoffman, a weapons researcher at the University of Oslo, is that the most likely explanation regarding the cause of the explosion is that a rocket fell apart in several phases and hit the hospital. According to Der Spiegel, Hoffman could not say for sure what caused the rocket's failure, but he suspected that the engine overheated, causing the rocket to fall to the ground.",
        "Agence France-Presse (AFP) published an article on 20 October 2023, reporting on interviews of several analysts, who \"remained cautious, preferring not to rule out any scenario.\" Heloise Fayet, a researcher at the French Institute of International Relations, said that it was difficult to link the minor damage observed at the hospital with the large explosion seen on video. Based on the nature and extent of the damages, Fayet concluded that the most likely scenario was that a rocket hit the gas tanks of several cars. The same AFP article quoted Joseph Henrotin, editor-in-chief of the journal Defense and International Security (DSI), as saying that the visible damage was \"consistent with the hypothesis of engine pieces, for example, of a rocket, which fall in a ballistic alignment, projecting debris, flaming materials, and creating a blast effect,\" at the same time noting that the absence of any structural damage to the building, the impact site being in the parking lot, and the size of the craters were all inconsistent with \"the ammunition and targeting capabilities available to the Israelis\". Similarly, Xavier Tytelman, an air defense consultant who also works for the magazine Air & Cosmos, said that the grade of munitions used by Israel, which frequently destroy entire buildings with a single strike, \"would have done infinitely more damage\" than that seen in the hospital parking lot, noting that the images of the scene were not comparable to the effects of laser-equipped JDAM bombs. Tytelman was also quoted as suggesting the rocket in question was likely an Iranian-designed Badr-3 and that its trajectory change was caused by faulty detachment of the first stage. The analysts interviewed by AFP stated that they could not completely rule out the scenario of a micro munition fired from an Israeli drone, at the same time observing that they were not aware of any evidence to support it. Specialists consulted by Le Monde also noted that the small explosion could be consistent with some missiles in Israel's arsenal, usually launched from helicopters or drones.",
        "CNN's investigative report from 21 October 2023, suggests that a rocket launched from Gaza malfunctioned mid-air, causing the explosion at a hospital complex. Experts consulted found the damage inconsistent with an Israeli airstrike. Missile expert Markus Schiller hypothesized that the rocket broke apart mid-air and ignited fuel at the hospital's car park, causing the explosion. Both Cedric Leighton, former National Security Agency of US deputy director, and Chad Ohlandt, a senior engineer at Rand Corporation, concurred. Analysis of mobile phone-captured audio also did not align with a high-grade military explosion. The experts noted a smaller impact crater and lack of wide destruction, undermining the possibility of an aircraft bomb. Patrick Senft from ARES and an unnamed explosives specialist emphasized that the damage was more likely caused by the rocket's fuel and shrapnel, rather than an artillery shell. All cautioned that definitive conclusions could not be made due to various limitations. In a follow-up report on 2 November 2023, CNN concluded that the Al Jazeera broadcast showed a projectile that was likely fired from Israel and had no connection to the explosion, reiterating that \"[u]ntil an independent investigation is allowed on the ground and evidence is collected from the site, the prospect of determining who was behind the blast is remote.\"",
        "The Wall Street Journal published a report on 21 October 2023 containing an analysis of four geolocated and verified videos of the incident, concluding that the explosion was caused by a misfired rocket.",
        "Channel 4 News noted that the explosion site contained only small craters, that buildings surrounding the explosion site were only superficially damaged (and did not structurally collapse), and some of the windows of a nearby church were undamaged\u2014all facts that made it unlikely that the cause of the explosion was a ground-detonating Israeli missile strike, without ruling out the possibility of an air-burst explosion. Channel 4 also observed that although Palestinian Islamic Jihad had indicated they had recovered a warhead, they have not produced it.",
        "India Today's OSINT Team analyzed the footage and images of the explosion and the aftermath as well as comparing the explosion site to previous aerial bombings by Israel. India Today reported on 18 October that the visual evidence does not match previous aerial bombings by Israel but that a more detailed investigation would be needed for a conclusive verdict.",
        "Le Monde's analysis on 3 November 2023 showed that several rockets were launched from at least two sites within Gaza toward Sderot 20 seconds before the explosion, and the path traveled by the rockets from one of those sites passed in close proximity of the al-Ahli Arab Hospital. A rocket launched from this site would have had to travel at a velocity of at least 100 meters per second to reach the hospital in a timeframe consistent with causing the explosion. Le Monde noted that a rocket with a range of approximately 15 kilometers would be required to reach Sderot from Gaza, and the velocity of such rockets exceed the required 100 meters per second. Based on these data points, Le Monde concluded that \"one of the rockets fired during this salvo could therefore have caused the explosion, but there is no evidence to prove this.\"",
        "Numerous other news outlets reported on similar opinions from experts they spoke with\u2014all agreeing that the cause of the explosion was more likely a misfired rocket than an Israeli airstrike. According to NPR, as of 19 October 2023, the majority of independent researchers conclude that the damage is not consistent with a standard Israeli air strike.",
        "Human Rights Watch found that \"the sound preceding the explosion, the fireball that accompanied it, the size of the resulting crater, the type of splatter adjoining it, and the type and pattern of fragmentation visible around the crater are all consistent with the impact of a rocket\" and that this was consistent with the type of rockets that Palestinian armed groups use.",
        "After the explosion, there was speculation on social media that Israel's Iron Dome air defense system could have played a role in causing the event. Der Spiegel relayed the analysis of weapons expert Fabian Hoffman, of the University of Oslo, who noted that the Iron Dome is not designed to intercept rockets during their ascent. Similarly, the Associated Press cited to the opinion of John Erath, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and an expert on missile defense, who also relayed that the Iron Dome is designed to intercept rockets during their downward path into Israeli territory\u2014not while they are in an upward trajectory\u2014though Erath conceded that it is not technically impossible for Iron Dome to destroy a rocket during its ascent. Retired US Army colonel David Shank, an expert in missiles, concurred with this view, telling the Associated Press that the air defense system is generally not engaged unless a rocket has a high probability of causing casualties or damage within Israel, and would not likely be used to destroy a rocket flying over Gaza. Experts consulted by CNN found no evidence that the Iron Dome intercepted the projectile that caused the explosion.",
        "Al Jazeera published an analysis of the hospital explosion on 19 October. Al Jazeera said they had constructed a second-by-second timeline by analyzing video footage of the event. According to Al Jazeera, a rocket launched from Gaza was intercepted by an Iron Dome interceptor and \"completely destroyed\" in mid-air five seconds before the hospital explosion. As no more rocket launches could be seen in video footage from Gaza from this time until the hospital explosion, Al Jazeera said that they found \"no grounds\" for the IDF assertion that the hospital explosion was caused by a failed rocket launch from Gaza. The investigation also identified \"four Israeli air strikes on Gaza, targeting the area near the hospital\" in the minutes before the explosion. Uzi Rubin, the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization, told the BBC that the video footage is not consistent with an Iron Dome interception, which causes \"an almost immediate sympathetic explosion of the hostile rocket warhead\" as opposed to the \"elongated glowing debris cloud that fades out after a couple of seconds\" seen in the video. By contrast, Marc Garlasco said he did believe the video was consistent with an Iron Dome interception.",
        "The death toll asserted by the Gazan Health Ministry was not independently verified as of 18 October. The Wall Street Journal reported that open-source intelligence analyst Blake Spendley estimated the death toll at 50, based on his review of videos and photos of the scene. Several analysts cast doubt on the death toll figure from the Gazan Health Ministry, citing the limited shock-wave damage and the small size of the open area. On 19 October, Agence France-Presse cited an unnamed senior European intelligence official who said he believed the death toll was no more than 50. A video geolocated by Bellingcat showed \"[a]t least two dozen bodies\" in a grassy area near the explosion.",
        "The New York Times, after reviewing video footage and witness accounts, said on 18 October that there were \"scores\" of bodies in the hospital's courtyard and the number of casualties was \"high\".",
        "The general director of Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital, which took in victims of the blast, estimated the death toll at 250, and journalist David Zweig argued that media reports of the Gaza Health Ministry claiming 500 deaths, instead of 500 casualties, appear to have originated from the Al-Jazeera English Twitter account that was copied by other news media without attribution to Al-Jazeera.",
        "Shortly after the explosion, IDF released an audio recording purportedly containing an intercepted conversation between two Hamas operatives saying that a misfired rocket launched by PIJ caused the explosion. BBC Verify and CNN said they could not verify the recording. Channel 4 News reported on a forensic analysis of the alleged Hamas operative audio released by the IDF, concluding that it was digitally manipulated. Channel 4 News spoke to two unnamed Arabic language journalists who said that the recording did not appear authentic, because the \"language, accent, dialect, syntax and tone\" were not credible. Channel 4 News also reported on a preliminary audio assessment performed by a sonic analysis company called Earshot, which concluded that the audio recording had been edited to fuse two channels that were recorded separately, one for each speaker. Voice of America and NBC News quote a US intelligence official who said that their conclusions regarding the cause of the explosion were based in part on another audio recording, different from the publicly available one and assessed as authentic by language experts.",
        "The Israeli Defense Forces said the cause of the blast was a misfired rocket targeting the Israeli city of Haifa and launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a Palestinian militant group allied with Hamas. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit said that intelligence indicated that PIJ had launched a barrage of rockets near the hospital, and shared drone-collected aerial photography that he said was inconsistent with Israeli munitions.",
        "The IDF also published audio that it says contains intercepted discussions among militants saying that their misfired rocket caused the explosion. BBC Verify said that it could not verify the recording. Hamas said the recording was fabricated. Channel 4 said that it was told by \"two independent Arab journalists\" that the audio was not credible \"because of the language, accent, dialect, syntax and tone\".",
        "On 18 October, the IDF released drone footage, which it said showed the hospital before and after the explosion. The annotated video showed burned vehicles in the hospital parking lot, and noted the apparent lack of a crater or significant structural damage to surrounding buildings. The IDF said these attributes were inconsistent with the aftermath of Israeli munition strikes.",
        "Following the explosion, the official Israel Twitter account published a statement saying that the attack was the result of an enemy rocket. Attached to the tweet was footage, purported to be proof of the rocket coming from Gaza. Aric Toler, a journalist on the visual investigations team of the The New York Times, noted that the timestamps on the video were at least 40 minutes after the explosion was known to have occurred. Shortly after, the Israeli government Twitter account edited the tweet, removing the video from it. The IDF said it was not involved with the video, and attributed it to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
        "According to The New York Times, Israel has declined its requests to share logs of its military activity in the area at the time of the explosion or say what video it was basing its assessment that a failed Palestinian rocket launch was responsible for the blast on.",
        "The Gaza Health Ministry said the explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike. Palestinian Islamic Jihad has denied responsibility, blaming Israel for the explosion and drawing attention to the fact that Israel had also hit the hospital on 14 October and previously ordered its evacuation. Hamas stated that Israel struck the hospital as punishment for the failure to evacuate.",
        "David Leonhardt of The New York Times wrote on 20 October that \"Gaza officials and their supporters have three main arguments, all circumstantial\":",
        "Hamas failed to produce or describe any evidence linking Israel to the explosion. Islamic Jihad claimed to have a missile fragment, but have not produced it.\" Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas spokesperson, told the Associated Press that Hamas would welcome a United Nations investigation of the cause of the explosion. He told the New York Times on 22 October that the munition was not available for inspection because it had \"dissolved like salt in the water. It's vaporized. Nothing is left\".",
        "A witness told Human Rights Watch that workers from Hamas's Interior Ministry removed all shrapnel from the explosion site. The BBC noted that, in photographs taken in the moments following the explosion, Hamas-affiliated security forces with clothing bearing logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit could be seen inspecting the point of impact. An expert consulted by the BBC said that it would be highly unusual for there to be no debris left behind by such an explosion. Le Monde observed that the Palestinian police's EOD division's duties, according to their website, include collecting projectile debris and the investigation of explosions. On 22 October 2023, Hamas declined a request by The New York Times to view any remnants of the object that had struck the parking lot, and did not answer specific questions from Human Rights Watch about the remnants in their written response on 25 November 2023.",
        "N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director of the Australia-based Armament Research Services, said that \"[o]ne would expect remnants to be recoverable in all but the most extreme circumstances, and the available imagery of the hospital site suggests something ought to be identifiable on the ground\", and he told The New York Times that recoverable debris should be present based on satellite imagery. Marc Garlasco echoed this sentiment, indicating that in his 20 years of investigating war crimes, including during three wars in Gaza, this is the first time there were no remnants to be seen. Hamas told The Washington Post that it possessed remnants of the munition and that \"they will soon be shown to the world,\" directly contradicting what was said to The New York Times. David Leonhardt concluded that Hamas's failure to produce evidence from the projectile \"suggests the group may not want outsiders to see it.\"",
        "US President Joe Biden supported the Israeli account of events, and referred to Pentagon intelligence sources that indicate the explosion was caused by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) rocket misfire.",
        "US officials said that the US had collected \"high confidence\" signals intelligence indicating that PIJ was responsible. Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the United States National Security Council, said, \"While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday.\" Other US intelligence officials concurred, adding the analysis was still preliminary and investigations would continue.",
        "Blake Spendley of CNA said on 18 October that \"At the moment, the preponderance of evidence does point to it being a Hamas or PIJ rocket hitting the area.\"",
        "On 24 October 2023, US intelligence officials briefed reporters or the New York Times, NBC News, and other US media, including  on the intelligence community's assessment of the explosion on condition of anonymity. The New York Times reported that Palestinian communications intercepted by Israel and publicly available video gave the intelligence community high confidence that a rocket launched from Gaza experienced a \"catastrophic motor failure,\" causing the warhead to fall near the hospital. The officials said their analysis focused primarily on the Al Jazeera video that captured the moment of the explosion during a live broadcast, though they also considered signals intelligence and images of the aftermath of the explosion. They further said that their assessment was also based on the absence of any Israeli weapon presented by Palestinians at the site of the explosion. According to the US officials, the videos showing the fireball and fire-damaged vehicles in the hospital parking lot are consistent with a malfunctioning missile. The officials also told the Times that they had authenticated communications intercepts provided by Israeli intelligence, all of which consisted of Hamas members \"discussing their belief that the explosion was caused by an errant or malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\" The officials also told the Times that they had low confidence in their assessment of a death toll between 100 and 300, noting that an accurate figure was impossible to confirm because of the absence of independent sources. The Washington Post reported that the US intelligence community had determined with \"high confidence\" that the cause of the explosion was not an Israeli airstrike and, \"absent other points of information and supporting material\", with \"low confidence\" that Palestinian fighters were responsible for the rocket that struck the parking lot. NBC News quoted an intelligence official who said that the intelligence community \"assessed with high confidence that Israel was not responsible for the explosion at the hospital and that Palestinian militants were responsible\" and that they assessed with low confidence that Palestine Islamic Jihad had launched the rocket.",
        "France's Directorate of Military Intelligence stated that a misfired rocket from within Gaza was the \"most probable cause\". A French military official who spoke with Associated Press on condition of anonymity stated that French intelligence drew this conclusion from classified information, satellite imagery, intelligence shared by other countries, and open-source information. The official stated that the blast crater was indicative of an explosive charge of approximately 5 kilograms, which is consistent with several types of rockets used by Palestinian militant groups. With regard to the origin of the rocket, the French official said that the impact hole suggested the projectile was on a south-to-north trajectory.  In addition, the French military intelligence official indicated that, while he could not say for certain, the reported death toll of 471 did not seem possible based on the apparent size of the rocket.",
        "As of 19October2023, Canada had refrained from taking a position regarding the cause of the explosion. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canadian officials \"saw some preliminary evidence,\" but would continue to work with allies \"before reaching any firm and final conclusion.\" On 21 October, Canada's Department of National Defence announced that an independent analysis conducted by Canadian Forces Intelligence Command had determined \"with a high degree of confidence that Israel did not strike the hospital on October 17, 2023,\" and that the more likely cause was an errant rocket fired from inside Gaza. The assessment was based on open source intelligence and classified reporting.",
        "Rishi Sunak, the UK Prime Minister, told the House of Commons that, relying on British intelligence agencies, the government had concluded that the blast was likely the result of a Palestinian rocket fired towards Israel.

        "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared three days of mourning following the deadly event and canceled a planned meeting with US President Joe Biden. Biden said that he was \"outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion\", but he did not immediately attribute blame for the incident, saying instead that the US would investigate the event. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the explosion as \"horrible\" and \"unacceptable\", but did not assign blame. The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, condemned the alleged attack. The secretary-general of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that he was \"horrified by the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in a strike on a hospital\".

    "Hurricane Otis": [
        "Hurricane Otis was a compact but very powerful tropical cyclone which made a devastating landfall in October 2023 near Acapulco as a Category 5 hurricane. Otis was the first Pacific hurricane to make landfall at Category5 intensity and surpassed Hurricane Patricia as the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. Otis was the costliest tropical cyclone to strike Mexico on record. The fifteenth tropical storm, tenth hurricane, eighth major hurricane, and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season, Otis originated from a disturbance several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Initially forecast to stay offshore and to only be a weak tropical storm at peak intensity, Otis instead underwent explosive intensification to reach peak winds of 165mph (270km/h). Otis weakened slightly shortly afterwards but still made landfall as a powerful Category5 hurricane. Once inland, the hurricane quickly weakened before dissipating the following day.",
        "Making landfall just west of Acapulco, Otis's powerful winds severely damaged many of the buildings in the city. Landslides and flooding resulted from heavy rain. Communication was heavily cut off, initially leaving information about the hurricane's impact largely unknown. In the aftermath, the city had no drinking water and many residents also lost power. The government of Guerrero mobilized thousands of military members to aid survivors and assist in recovery efforts. Thousands of recovery items were sent out to those affected and donations were sent out to each of the affected families.",
        "The hurricane caused at least 52 deaths and left 32 others missing. Total damage from Otis was estimated to be billions of dollars (2023 USD), with several agencies estimating from $12 to $16 billion in damage, making it the costliest Mexican hurricane, surpassing Hurricane Wilma.",
        "On October15, 2023, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that an area of low pressure was expected to form several hundred miles south of southeastern Mexico over the next seven days. This forecast came to fruition on October18 with the development of a broad low several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Accompanied by disorganized convection, organization into a tropical cyclone was deemed likely within five days as the system meandered in the same general area. Convection grew in scope the following day, though upper-level wind shear displaced this to the west of the system's center. Throughout October21, convection increased in coverage and the system's surface circulation became more defined. The disturbance's meandering motion shifted to a northward crawl as it was wedged between a ridge to the northeast and a trough to the northwest. Following further convective organization, the system became Tropical Depression Eighteen-E at 12:00UTC (07:00a.m. CDT) on October22. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 535mi (860km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Six hours later, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Otis.",
        "Light to moderate southeasterly wind shear displaced convection northwest of Otis's surface circulation during the overnight hours of October22\u201323. The lack of vertical alignment and dry mid-level air delayed potential intensification despite an otherwise favorable environment consisting of high sea surface temperatures and abundant atmospheric moisture. Sea surface temperatures ahead of the system averaged 86\u201388\u00b0F (30\u201331\u00b0C), above average for this time of year. The high temperatures resulted from a combination of a record-warm September for Mexico, an ongoing El Ni\u00f1o, and the influence of global warming. The system's motion shifted from due north to north-northwest during this time, remaining around 4\u20135mph (6\u20138km/h). A convective band developed halfway around the storm by the afternoon of October23 and the surface circulation moved closer to thunderstorm activity. During the overnight of October23\u201324, the storm moved into a region of more favorable conditions, with higher sea surface temperatures and weaker vertical wind shear. microwave satellite imagery depicted a low-level ring structure, despite the overall sheared appearance of the system. The storm's forward motion also increased during this time, potentially offsetting the negative impacts of southeasterly wind shear. As a result, upper-level outflow expanded noticeably and the system's core became centered in the convection. This led to Otis beginning an intensification phase that would continue until landfall. As the morning of October24 progressed, outflow continued to expand in all directions atop Otis and many banding features circulated the storm. The improvement in outflow was accentuated by a powerful jet streak\u2014a wind maxima within the jet stream\u2014which accelerated the rate of latent heat dispersal and fostered convective development. Otis became a hurricane by 12:00UTC (07:00 CDT) on October24.",
        "Shortly after 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT), the only Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter mission flown into Otis penetrated its eye, and the observations determined that Otis had already reached Category3 intensity and thus become a major hurricane. This was substantially above estimates using the Dvorak technique, which ranged from only 70mph (110km/h) to 105mph (165km/h); Otis was persistently stronger than indicated by the Dvorak technique throughout the rapid intensification phase. Operationally, the NHC had only upgraded Otis to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Explosive intensification continued throughout the day into the nighttime hours, in what was described as a \"nightmare scenario\" by Eric Blake at the NHC. A prominent pinhole eye developed as the night progressed, surrounded by intense convection reaching \u2212103 to \u2212112\u00b0F (\u221275 to \u221280\u00b0C). Otis reached its peak intensity as a Category5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 165mph (270km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 922mb (27.23inHg) at 03:00UTC on October25 (10:00p.m. CDT, October24)\u2013just nine hours after attaining Category3 intensity\u2013while located just 60mi (95km) south-southeast of Acapulco. Immense lightning activity occurred throughout the intensification phase, approximately 26,000 strikes in 24hours, with the greatest activity taking place in the 55minutes leading up to landfall. As Otis neared landfall, satellite images showed some cooling and filling in of the eye, suggesting that the storm weakened slightly before landfall. By 05:45UTC (12:45a.m. CDT), Isla de La Roqueta[es] entered the hurricane's eyewall and the storm's core made landfall just west of Acapulco around 06:45UTC (1:25a.m. CDT) just below peak intensity, though still at Category5 intensity, with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 929mb (27.43inHg). Once onshore, the hurricane rapidly weakened as it interacted with the mountains of the Sierra Madre del Sur. Within two hours, its eye disappeared from satellite imagery and lightning activity ceased. Utilizing statistical inland decay models, the NHC estimated Otis to have fallen below hurricane status by 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT). The storm's surface circulation dissipated shortly thereafter, marking the cessation of Otis's time as a tropical cyclone.",
        "The rapid intensification of Otis was among the most poorly forecast in the modern era. Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Bob Henson at Yale University called the underestimation \"one of the biggest and most consequential forecast-model misses of recent years\". Numerical weather prediction models failed to capture the magnitude of explosive intensification that occurred, in part due to a dearth of data. Several experts, including director of the National Hurricane Center Michael Brennan, noted that there are very few instruments \u2014 such as ocean buoys or radar \u2014 available for evaluating hurricane strength in the East Pacific, leaving forecasters reliant on satellite data. As described by the New York Times, forecasts of Otis upon its formation on October22 \"didn\u2019t show much to be concerned about\". In their first advisory, the NHC forecast a peak intensity of just 45mph (75km/h), 120mph (195km/h) lower than its actual peak intensity, with the system moving north-northwest and later west away from the Mexican coastline. Forecasters John Cangialosi and Lisa Bucci noted that many models showed the storm outright dissipating within five days.",
        "Early on October23, Blake noted that models were incorrectly diagnosing conditions and showing Otis intertwined with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. He adjusted his forecast to show a faster motion which would bring the system onto the Mexican coastline on October26. Later that day, forecasters Cangialosi and Sandy Delgado noted a substantial disparity in various model solutions, with results differing based on how vertically aligned the storm would become or not become. Conditions for a more potent system became more apparent during the overnight hours of October23\u201324. This included high sea surface temperatures, lower wind shear, and abundant moisture. The system also became vertically aligned. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) rapid intensification index increased to 25percent, leading forecasters to raise their intensity predictions above most model outputs. At 09:00UTC (4:00a.m. CDT) on October24, less than 24 hours before landfall, the NHC expected Otis to intensify into a Category1 hurricane as it moved ashore. Sixteen hours prior to landfall, the system was forecast to move ashore at least five hours later than it actually did. The dramatic rate of intensification was not apparent until reconnaissance aircraft sampled the storm during the afternoon of October24. At 00:00UTC on October25 (7:00p.m. CDT, October24), just under six and a half hours before the storm made landfall, the NHC upgraded Otis to a Category4 hurricane and explicitly forecast it to become a Category5 hurricane before making landfall.",
        "The rate of Hurricane Otis's intensification was among the fastest observed in the satellite-era. In a 21-hour period, the hurricane's maximum sustained winds increased by 105mph (165km/h), ranking it as the second-fastest in the basin, only behind Hurricane Patricia in 2015, which increased by 120mph (195km/h) in a period of 24 hours. With winds of 160mph (260km/h), Otis became the first Pacific hurricane on record to make landfall at Category5 intensity, surpassing Hurricane Patricia accordingly. Overall, it was tied with the Hurricane Gilbert of 1988 in the Atlantic as the fourth-strongest landfalling Mexican hurricane by sustained wind speed, behind the following Atlantic hurricanes, each with sustained winds of 175mph (280km/h): Janet in 1955, Anita in 1977, and Dean in 2007. Masters and Henson surmised Otis's landfall saw the most people impacted by the eyewall of a Category5 hurricane. They further stated the only hurricane of comparison was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck the Miami metropolitan area at Category5 strength (producing such winds in parts of southern Miami-Dade County).",
        "The Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch for areas east of Tecpan de Galeana to Lagunas de Chacahua at 03:00UTC October24. As the storm approached land and intensified further, a hurricane warning was issued for the Guerrero coastline between Punta Maldonado and Zihuatanejo at 09:00UTC October24, 21 hours before landfall. In response to the approach of Hurricane Otis, the Guerrero state government opened 396 shelters to accommodate residents displaced by the heavy wind and storm surge damage. Mexico's army and navy sent 8,000 troops to support aid and rescue operations. Authorities in Guerrero closed Acapulco's main port. Schools across Guerrero were to be closed ahead of Otis's anticipated landfall. All flights in and out of Acapulco International Airport were cancelled.",
        "In its advisory upgrading Otis to a Category5 hurricane, 3 hours and 45 minutes before landfall, the NHC described the situation as a \"nightmare scenario\" and warned that \"This is an extremely serious situation for the Acapulco metropolitan area with the core of the destructive hurricane likely to come near or over that large city early on Wednesday. There are no hurricanes on record even close to this intensity for this part of Mexico\".",
        "Hurricane Otis made landfall in Acapulco as a Category5 hurricane on October25, making it by far the strongest hurricane to ever strike this area of Mexico. On October30, the National Autonomous University of Mexico tweeted that data from two weather stations in Acapulco Bay were recovered. One station measured peak sustained winds of 113.64mph (182.88km/h) with a gust to 204.90mph (329.76km/h) at 05:40UTC (12:40a.m. CDT). If verified, this would be the seventh highest anemometer-measured wind gust recorded worldwide. A minimum pressure of 963.5mb (28.45inHg) was also observed at 05:50UTC (12:50a.m. CDT). A weather station on Isla de La Roqueta[es] offshore western Acapulco recorded a maximum wind gust of 135mph (217km/h) as the eyewall moved across the city. Peak sustained winds of 82mph (132km/h) were also reported by the station. The storm surge was catastrophic near and east of the point of landfall, but a lack of tide station data prevented a quantitative estimate of the height.",
        "Across Guerrero, 37 transmission lines, 26 electrical substations, a power generation plant, and 10,000 light poles were downed, resulting in more than 500,000 households losing power, although service was quickly restored to 200,000 and was fully restored on November 1. Throughout Acapulco, 51,864 houses were destroyed, while 79,510 others suffered severe damage and 80,823 other homes suffered minor or moderate damage. A total of 3,813 people necessitated air rescue through 62 flights while 20,047 others evacuated via bus. About 80% of all hotels in Acapulco sustained damage, including reports of flooding and collapsed ceilings inside hotels. Several buildings were also heavily damaged or collapsed. Eighteen radio stations in Acapulco were downed, and communication was cut off in the city. The city also lost access to drinking water. A total of 110 medical facilities were out of operation due to the storm, but 80% of such facilities had re-opened by November 7. Five shopping centers necessitated closure, although four re-opened within a week and a half. Additionally, a shopping center in Acapulco was destroyed, and a section of a highway leading into the city was closed after a landslide. Forty-one sections of highways were damaged throughout Guerrero. A large amount of the state's crop yields, which was valued at 25.2 billion pesos in 2022, was destroyed. Offshore, 480 public tourist boats were destroyed. At least 33 vessels sunk in Acapulco Bay. Five boats were rescued offshore Playa Manzanillo while two small vessels were found in the bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s. Further inland, ten road accidents occurred in the Toluca Valley in the state of Mexico, resulting in two deaths. Statewide, 478 individuals were injured, 98 of whom required hospitalization.",
        "Several airlines were impacted by Otis, with service on Aerom\u00e9xico, Volaris, and Viva Aerobus affected and suspended at Acapulco and Zihuatanejo. Acapulco International Airport, which was closed to all flights, was inaccessible. Additionally, the Pie de la Cuesta Air Force Base near Acapulco was damaged, which made it difficult for rescue operations. Otis's passage knocked offline a significant part of the seismic network in Guerrero owned by SkyAlert, an earthquake warning app used widely in Mexico, as well as the SASMEX Network, another network owned by CIRES, responsible of broadcasting alerts through public speakers and radio signals. Twenty-seven sensors were affected throughout Guerrero and parts of neighboring states Michoac\u00e1n and Oaxaca, as well as two broadcast towers in the cities of Acapulco and Chilpancingo, hindering the ability to notify major cities both close and farther away prone to damage in case an earthquake occurs along the coasts of those three states. By October 28, 19 of the sensors had been restored.",
        "Losses were estimated at US$15 billion by the natural disaster risk analysis firm Enki Research, and at more than US$10 billion by global reinsurance firm Gallagher Re., meaning Otis possibly exceeds Hurricane Wilma as Mexico's most expensive weather disaster ever recorded at US$7.5 billion. Fitch Ratings estimated that Otis was responsible for US$16 billion in insured losses. Tourism authorities considered Otis the worst hurricane to hit Acapulco, with its impact more severe than both Hurricane Pauline and Hurricane Manuel. Government officials believed that it would cost between 200 and 300 billion pesos (US$11.4 and 17.2 billion) to repair the damage in Acapulco. Officials estimated that as a result of the storm, the Guerrero gross domestic product will decline by 16% by the start of 2024. Citigroup estimated that economic activity in the final quarter of 2023 would shrink by 40% due to the hurricane. According to Reuters, Mexican business groups estimate damage at $16 billion as of November17, 2023. Based on these and other reports, the NHC determined that Otis caused $12\u201316&nbspace;billion of damage and that it was thus the costliest Mexican hurricane on record, surpassing Hurricane Wilma in the Atlantic.",
        "As of December21, 2023, the official figures stand at 52 people killed and 32 missing, with three foreigners included in the death toll as well as at least two students attending the Autonomous University of Guerrero (AUG). In the village of Kil\u00f3metro 30, a two-year-old girl was swept away by floodwaters after she left her mother's arms. A total of 59 people were reported missing, including 11 Americans and 7 other foreign nationals. Early media reports of an additional 16 fatalities following a power outage at a Mexican Social Security Institute hospital were denied by the government. Local officials told the Washington Post that they had counted 120 dead or missing, including 20 bodies that washed up onto Acapulco beach or by the docks, 10 bodies that were found floating in the ocean 16 kilometres (10mi) west of Acapulco, two people who were missing from a vessel of three, and three people who died at sea on a four-person boat.",
        "Locals have criticized the official death toll as an underestimate, to which President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador responded by accusing his opponents of making the death toll a political issue. At the time of the first death toll estimate of 27, L\u00f3pez Obrador said that \"even though the death of any person is unfortunate, there weren't very many\". On November 12, a report emerged indicating that Acapulco's funeral homes had calculated a total of at least 350 deaths. The following day, municipal authorities dismissed the report as \"speculation\" and, during a press conference, L\u00f3pez Obrador reiterated that the official death toll remained at 48.",
        "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the state of Guerrero was the least prepared state for a natural disaster. Although there were 14 civil protection public servants per 100,000 inhabitants, half of those are dedicated to administrative functions, one quarter of those are firefighters, and less than 15% of servants can aid in search and rescue. Nevertheless, the government of Guerrero mobilized 30 to 40 trucks to transport displaced tourists to shelter. With resources totaling approximately US$1.7 billion, the government initially believed it had the economic resources necessary to repair the damage to Guerrero, although the congressional bloc of Morena offered an additional 10 million pesos in aid on October 26. On November 1, the federal government announced 61.3 billion pesos in investments for reconstruction, including 18 billion for infrastructure recovery and 10 billion worth of tax breaks, 45,000 additional scholarships to Acapulco students, hiring 10,000 young people to aid in cleanup efforts, and free electricity through February 2024. On November 3, the federal government announced that each of the 250,000 affected families in Acapulco and Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez would receive weekly baskets of foodstuffs over the following three months, totaling between 2 billion and 3 billion pesos. However, the federal government rejected calls from the Chamber of Deputies to use oil surpluses, estimated to total up to 80 billion pesos, to fund additional recovery efforts. Citigroup criticized the federal government package as insufficient. A sit in outside the National Palace was organized to protest the lack of government assistance, in which 50 people participated. Victims petitioned the Mexican Senate to demand the establishment of a 300 billion pesos trust.",
        "In addition to financial assistance, 47 of Guerrero's 81 municipalities were initially declared a disaster area, but this was later reduced to cover only two municipalities (Acapulco and Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez). Ten doctors from Michoac\u00e1n were flown in to Acapulco to assist with recovery efforts. By October 28, the government provided 8,100 liters (1,800impgal; 2,100U.S.gal) of food supplies and 16,000 liters (3,500impgal; 4,200U.S.gal) of water to Acapulco. By November 1, the government had delivered 63,000 food packages and 1,600,000 liters (350,000impgal; 420,000U.S.gal) of water. By November 4, the government had delivered 1,874,400 liters (412,300impgal; 495,200U.S.gal) of water, including to 11,350,000 liters (2,500,000impgal; 3,000,000U.S.gal) to hospitals, 60,000 liters (13,000impgal; 16,000U.S.gal) to shelters, and 385,000 liters (85,000impgal; 102,000U.S.gal) to water treatment plants. By November 5, they delivered 204,092 meals. By November 7, 8,602 kilograms (18,964lb) of crgo had been airlifted. A total of 37,000 liters (8,100impgal; 9,800U.S.gal) of diesel, 80,000 liters (18,000impgal; 21,000U.S.gal) of gasoline and 35,000 liters (7,700impgal; 9,200U.S.gal) of jet fuel was distributed by the government. The military distributed 97,805 food supplies, 36,400 kilograms (80,200lb) of tortillas, and 145,000 food rations through 13 dining rooms and five community kitchens. The Mexican Navy alone provided 4,000 groceries, 156,450 liters (34,410impgal; 41,330U.S.gal) of water, over 13,000 kilograms (29,000lb) of supplies, including 2,000 kilograms (4,400lb) of personal hygiene and medical items, and packaged 33,243 meals. At the naval hospital, 1,037 medical consultations were given, including 16 surgeries. The military also provided 2,345 medical consultations and made 11 medical evacuations, 10 by air and 1 by land. On November 2, they distributed 120,000 liters (26,000impgal; 32,000U.S.gal) to five hospitals in Acapulco, which were operating at 10% of capacity. By November 3, normal operations had been reestablished at 37 gas stations, with a total inventory of 24,500,000 liters (5,400,000impgal; 6,500,000U.S.gal) of fuel. By November 6, normal operations had been resumed at 60 gas stations, or 75% of gas stations in Acapulco. Local authorities estimated that they had cleaned up 250 metric tons (250 long tons; 280 short tons) of garbage along coastal areas of Acapulco.",
        "The Tax Administration Service (SAT) delayed all tax deadlines for residents until November 10. The Secretary of National Defense launched a food collection drive in Nuevo Laredo. The Mexican Red Cross delivered 75 metric tons (74 long tons; 83 short tons) of humanitarian aid and mobilized 300 volunteers in Acapulco. Walmart offered to match all donations made to the victims of the storm. Banco Santander offered to suspend loan payments for all victims for six months. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) delivered 562,000kg (1,239,000lb) of aid. AUG provided 50 buses for victims to travel between Acapulco and Chilpancingo. The United States government provided Mexico with equipment to re-open the roads and said it would honor any requests from the Mexican government for assistance. The Association of Banks of Mexico launched a payment deferral program that an estimated 300,000 individuals were eligible for, totaling 22 billion pesos. Some tolls on Federal Highway 95D were lifted in order to aid in relief efforts. Free bus service was offered from Acapulco to Mexico City through November 5. Telmex offered free services for all of Acaupulco for Novedmber and December 2023. Eleven charging stations were opened in which individuals could use for up to 15 minutes. Widespread looting also occurred throughout the city after the storm, prompting President L\u00f3pez Obrador to deploy 14,700 members of the National Guard to erect checkpoints and resulting in a 70% increase in food prices.",
        "Despite the damage, some hotels sought to resume operations in time for the holiday season. In addition, 35 hotels promised the federal government that they would re-open by the end of March 2024. The Secretariat of Tourism also announced that the Tianguis Tur\u00edstico[es] annual tourism fair set to be held in Acapulco in April 2024 would not be cancelled."

    "2023 Guyana\u2013Venezuela crisis": [
        "Irfaan Ali Mark Phillips\n Omar Khan Robert Persaud Hugh Todd",
        "The long-standing territorial dispute over the Essequibo region escalated into a crisis in 2023. The region is controlled by Guyana but is claimed by Venezuela. The dispute dates back many years and the current border was established by the Paris Arbitral Award in 1899. Venezuela renewed its claim in 1962 and the matter was referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2018.",
        "Significant oil reserves were discovered offshore in the 2010s, which raised the stakes. In September 2023, Guyana granted drilling licences in the disputed waters. In December 2023, Venezuela held a referendum of its people asking whether the region should become a state of Venezuela and its population become citizens, among other questions. Although the turnout was reported to be low, the Venezuelan government declared that the results showed overwhelming support for such action. Venezuela then took further steps to press its claim such as publishing maps showing the territory annexed to the country and announcing plans to develop the region.",
        "In response to Venezuela's actions, other countries supported Guyana's position including Brazil, the UK and US. Brazil sent troops to its border with the region and the US conducted military exercises with Guyana. The ICJ warned Venezuela not to take any direct action in the region as a trial is scheduled for early 2024 and the Mercosur regional group urged the parties to find a peaceful solution.",
        "On 14 December 2023, Ralph Gonsalves, the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, hosted a meeting of the leaders of Guyana and Venezuela, as an initiative of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, which he currently heads. Officials from the Caribbean Community, Brazil, Colombia and the United Nations also attended. The leaders agreed to not use any force or escalate tension. A joint statement said that both countries will settle the dispute in accordance with international law, despite adding that Venezuela does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICJ. Further talks in Brazil are expected by April 2024.",
        "Essequibo started off as a colony of the Dutch and was founded by colonists from the first Zeelandic colony, Pomeroon, conquered in 1581, which had been destroyed by Spaniards and local warriors around 1596. Led by Joost van der Hooge, the Zeelanders travelled to an island called Kyk-Over-Al near the Essequibo River (actually a tributary called the Mazaruni). Dutch colonisation of the Guianas occurred primarily between the mouths of the Orinoco River in the west and the Amazon River to the east. In 1658, cartographer Cornelis Goliath created a map of the colony and made plans to build a city there called \"New Middelburg\", but the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665\u201367) put an end to these plans. Essequibo was occupied by the British in 1665 (along with all other Dutch colonies in the Guianas), and then plundered by the French. The following years the Zeelanders sent a squadron of ships to retake the area. While the Suriname colony was captured from the English by Abraham Crijnssen, the by-then abandoned Essequibo was occupied by Matthys Bergenaar.",
        "After 1745, the number of plantations along the Demerara River and its tributaries rapidly increased, resulting with the Demerara colony. Particularly, British colonists from Barbados began settling here. After 1750 a commander of the British population was assigned, giving them their own representation. Around 1780 a small central settlement was established at the mouth of the Demerara River, which received the name Stabroek in 1784, named after one of the directors of the West Indian Company. A group of British privateers captured Essequibo and Demerara on 24 February 1781, but did not stay. In March, two sloops of a Royal Navy squadron under Admiral Lord Rodney accepted the surrender of \"Colony of Demarary and the River Essequebo\". From 27 February 1782 to February 1783 the French occupied the colony after compelling Governor Robert Kinston to surrender. The peace of Paris, which occurred in 1783, restored these territories to the Dutch.",
        "In 1796, the Essequibo was permanently occupied by the British and by 1800, Essequibo and Demerara collectively held around 380 sugarcane plantations. But it also became involved in one of Latin America's most persistent border disputes because the new colony had the Essequibo river as its west border with the Spanish Captaincy General of Venezuela. Although Spain still claimed the region, the Spanish did not contest the treaty because they were preoccupied with their own colonies' struggles for independence. In 1822, independence leader Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar ordered his representative in London, Jos\u00e9 Rafael Revenga, to present an official complaint to the British authorities, writing: \"The settlers of Demerara and Berbice have usurped a large portion of land that according to the last treaties between Spain and Holland belong to us on this side of the Essequibo River. [...] that said colonists place themselves under the jurisdiction and obedience of our laws or withdraw to their former possessions\". After Venezuela obtained its independence in 1830, it defined its borders as those that made up the former Captaincy General of Venezuela, which included the Essequibo region. On 21 July 1831, Demerara-Essequibo was united with Berbice to create British Guiana.",
        "Under the aegis of the Royal Geographical Society, the German-born explorer and naturalist Robert Hermann Schomburgk conducted botanical and geographical exploration of British Guiana in 1835. This resulted in a sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this, he was commissioned in 1840 by the British government to survey Guiana's boundaries. This survey resulted in what came to be known as the \"Schomburgk Line\". The line went well beyond the area of British occupation and gave British Guiana control of the mouth of the Orinoco River. Schomburgk's initial sketch, which had been published in 1840, was the only version of the \"Schomburgk Line\" published until 1886, which led to later accusations by US President Grover Cleveland that the line had been extended \"in some mysterious way\".",
        "In 1850, Britain and Venezuela reached an agreement whereby they accepted not to colonise the disputed territory, although it was not established where this territory began and ended. The dispute went unmentioned for many years until gold was discovered in the region, which disrupted relations between the United Kingdom and Venezuela. In 1876, gold mines inhabited mainly by English-speaking people had been established in the Cuyuni basin, which was Venezuelan territory beyond the Schomburgk line but within the area Schomburgk thought Britain could claim. That year, Venezuela reiterated its claim up to the Essequibo River, to which the British responded with a counterclaim including the entire Cuyuni basin, although this was a paper claim the British never intended to pursue.",
        "In October 1886 Britain declared the Schomburgk Line to be the provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. In 1894, Venezuela appealed to the United States to intervene, citing the Monroe Doctrine as justification. The United States did not want to get involved, only going as far as suggesting the possibility of arbitration.",
        "During the Venezuelan crisis of 1895, the United Kingdom and Venezuela attempted to settle the territorial dispute. Venezuela argued that Spain\u2014whose territory they had acquired\u2014controlled land from the Orinoco River to the Amazon River in present-day Brazil. Spain, according to Venezuela, only designated its claimed Guiana territory to the Dutch, which did not include much land within the disputed territory. Meanwhile, Britain, who had acquired the Dutch territory, stated that the disputed Guiana region was not Spanish because it was so remote and uncontrolled, explaining that the original natives in the land had shared the territory's land with the Dutch instead of the Spanish and were thus under Dutch and British influence. On 3 October 1899 the tribunal ruled largely in favour of Britain. The Schomburgk Line was, with two deviations, established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela. One deviation was that Venezuela received Barima Point at the mouth of the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second placed the border at the Wenamu River rather than the Cuyun\u00ed River, giving Venezuela substantial territory east of the line. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the gold mines.",
        "In 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government a memorandum written by Mallet-Prevost, which was written in 1944 to be published only after his death. Mallet-Prevost surmised from the private behaviour of the judges that there had been a political deal between Russia and Britain, and said that the Russian chair of the panel, Friedrich Martens, had visited Britain with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899, and subsequently had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed, or a 3-to-2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3-to-2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens to avoid depriving Venezuela of even more territory. Said memorandum led to complaints by Venezuela in the United Nations in 1962.",
        "Venezuela signed the Geneva Agreement in 1966 with the United Kingdom prior to the independence of Guyana, which occurred that same year, which established bases for a negotiated solution to the territorial dispute. Five months after Guyana's independence, Venezuelan troops began their occupation of Ankoko island and surrounding islands in October 1966 with Venezuelan troops quickly constructing military installations and an airstrip. In 1969, the Rupununi uprising occurred in an attempt by ranch owners to secede from Guyana.",
        "By 1970, after the expiry of the Mixed Commission established according to the 1966 Geneva Agreement, Presidents Rafael Caldera and Forbes Burnham signed the Port of Spain Protocol, which declared a 12-year moratorium on Venezuela's reclamation of the Essequibo, with the purpose of allowing both governments to promote cooperation and understanding while the border claim was in abeyance. In 1983, the deadline of the Port of Spain Protocol expired, and the Venezuelan President Luis Herrera Campins decided not to extend it anymore and resume the effective claim over the territory.",
        "Into the 21st century, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez eased border tensions with Guyana under advice of his mentor Fidel Castro and in 2004, Ch\u00e1vez said during a visit in Georgetown, Guyana, that he considered the dispute to be finished. In response to Ch\u00e1vez's nationalisation of oil assets primarily belonging to ExxonMobil, it spearheaded efforts to find oil in neighbouring Guyana in the 2000s. ExxonMobil has been involved in multiple disputes with Venezuela over such assets, with US analyst Steve LeVine considering it was very litigious and \"sending a signal\" to others considering interfering with their contracts, with multiple defeated attempts at arbitration over sixteen years, the latest submitted on 27 November 2023.",
        "Venezuela became more aggressive towards Guyana during the administration of Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The Venezuelan Navy detained an oil exploration vessel conducting seafloor surveys on behalf of the government of Guyana on 10 October 2013, with the ship and its crew being escorted to the Venezuelan Margarita Island to be prosecuted. The Guyanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the vessel was in Guyanese waters, but its Venezuelan counterpart sent a diplomatic note to Guyana stating that the ship was conducting oil research in Venezuelan waters with no authorisation from the country, and demanded an explanation. Maduro visited Guyana and discussed the dispute. In Georgetown, Maduro affirmed that the Geneva Agreement was signed by \"an old Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica government and the old British Empire\" as part of a \"psyop, through contempt and racism, to invade Guyana\".",
        "Guyana handed new oil concessions to ExxonMobil in 2014, whose Venezuelan assets Ch\u00e1vez had nationalised seven years prior. In 2015, Venezuela accused ExxonMobil of breaching international law while drilling for oil in Guyana, and a minor crisis broke out wherein Guyanese authorities seized a Venezuelan vessel, the Yakuana, in Guyanas's territorial waters, with both parts demanding an explanation for the other; they later agreed to meet to try to improve delimitation of each other's territorial waters. Maduro announced in 2015 that he would take the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and in 2018 Guyana initiated an arbitration proceeding against Venezuela to decide the validity of the 1899 Paris Award.",
        "Between 2015 and 2021, the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote that about 8 billion barrels of oil reserves were discovered in Guyana, with Guyana becoming among the top twenty countries by proven oil reserves. By 2023, BBC News reported that Guyana had discovered 11 billion barrels worth of oil reserves. Guyanese Natural Resources Minister Rafael Trotman admitted that ExxonMobil had financially backed Guyana for legal disputes, in addition to a \"non-disclosed signing bonus\" paid by ExxonMobil according to then president David Granger. ExxonMobil Country Manager, Rod Henson, said the payments were customary and usual for petroleum agreements. Guyanese experts noted the government had ignored environmental concerns and that ExxonMobil had no oversight and its executives were frequently seen with top officials, with ExxonMobil having embarked on a public relations and regulatory capture campaign.",
        "On 7 January 2021, President Maduro issued Decree No. 4,415, claiming 200 nautical miles of seabed from the Orinoco Delta for Venezuela, extending into where Guyana made oil discoveries. Days later on 21 January, Guaicamacuto-class patrol boat Commandante Hugo Chavez GC 24 captured two Guyanese fishing boats within the EEZ of Guyana. Months later on 2 March 2021, two Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets of the Venezuelan Air Force made low passes at 1,500 feet (460m) over the Guyanese town of Eteringbang. Guyanese Foreign Minister Hugh Todd responded to the incident a day later, stating \"the incursion of our territory of the two Venezuelan fighter jets is a clear indication that the government of Venezuela is prepared to use aggression and intimidation to accomplish what cannot be accomplished by legal means: the surrender by Guyana of its patrimony.\"",
        "In April 2023, the ICJ ruled that it has jurisdiction over the dispute in a lawsuit filed by Guyana in 2018 to determine which nation controlled the disputed territory. Following further discoveries of oil and gas fields, on 19 September 2023, Guyana authorised six foreign oil companies including ExxonMobil to drill in the waters claimed by Venezuela. In October, ExxonMobil Guyana Limited (EMGL) President, Alistair Routledge, told reporters that \"we have not been scared away by Venezuela\u2026that\u2019s why we\u2019re still working in Guyana. That\u2019s why we anticipate continuing to do so for decades to come\". Guyana also criticised Venezuela for rejecting the ICJ's prerogative to rule on the matter after it rejected their proposal of establishing direct talks instead.",
        "On October 23, 2023, the National Electoral Council approved several issues, and the Constitutional Council of the Supreme Court of Justice officially confirmed it on November 1, 2023. The government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro promoted a consultative referendum in Venezuela for 3 December 2023 in which five questions were asked of citizens, among them, whether they agree to \"oppose, by all means, in accordance with the law, Guyana's claim to unilaterally dispose of a sea pending delimitation, illegally and in violation of international law\" and whether they would be in favour of giving Venezuelan nationality to the 125,000 inhabitants of the Essequibo. The government has criticised the \"abuses of ExxonMobil\" and the United States Southern Command, deploying a media campaign that has appealed to Venezuelan patriotism.",
        "Opposition leaders provided different responses to the referendum. Presidential candidate for the opposition political coalition Mar\u00eda Corina Machado assured that sovereignty was not consulted, but rather exercised, and asked to suspend the referendum to form a national team with the purpose of filing a claim with the ICJ, while Manuel Rosales and Henrique Capriles, both former opposition presidential candidates, were in favour. Rosales called on Venezuelans to vote in the referendum, and Capriles announced that he would participate in the referendum. The referendum caused a diplomatic crisis between both nations.",
        "In October 2023, it was reported that the Venezuelan military was building a runway near the border with Guyana's Essequibo \"to develop\" the region. Guyana's president Irfaan Ali responded by saying the country will not give up \"an inch\" of the region. Guyana asked for Venezuela to explain their troop buildup in the border, and the Venezuelan ambassador Carlos Amador P\u00e9rez Silva said that the troops were mobilised to curb illegal mining in the region.",
        "In the context of increasing tensions between the two countries, Guyana's main opposition party, Alliance for Change, called on 4 November for a ban on Venezuelans with Guyanese citizenship from voting in elections, as well as not granting citizenship to more people from the neighbouring country.",
        "Representatives of both Venezuela and Guyana asked in a hearing held at the ICJ in mid-November 2023 that the Court recognise their sovereignty over the Essequibo. Guyana also requested that the referendum be repealed, alleging that Venezuela intended to annex the territory, a request that the Venezuelan government rejected. Guyanese Prime Minister Mark Anthony Phillips took the case to the Organization of American States (OAS) where he accused Venezuela of a military buildup near the Essequibo border, and warned of the consequences of it for Guyana's sovereignty. OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the United States government expressed their support for Guyana.",
        "On 23 November, senior military officers from the Guyana Defence Force and the Brazilian Armed Forces met for a military exchange. Brazil has been a strong supporter of Guyana in the border dispute.",
        "Brazil is currently trying to establish mediation between both countries to avoid an armed conflict. Two teams from the United States Department of Defense were scheduled to visit Guyana in late November. Guyana proposed establishing foreign military bases in its country. The Brazilian Army mobilised towards the border of both countries anticipating a possible Venezuelan invasion. Reports from Brazilian intelligence in early December suggested an imminent military move by the Venezuelan Army against Guyana in the coming days, raising concerns about regional stability and territorial disputes in South America.",
        "The Brazilian foreign ministry, Itamaraty, held a summit between foreign and defence ministers of South American countries on 22 November, wherein Venezuelan foreign minister F\u00e9lix Osorio claimed Venezuela \"may be forced by the people to take measures\" On the same day, Brazil sent special envoy Celso Amorim to Caracas, wherein he talked directly with Maduro, who told him there would be no war, but the Brazilian government remained worried, and Amorim warned that the situation could \"spiral out of control\". Amorim stated Brazil would \"not accept any solution that is not peaceful\".",
        "On 30 November, Brazilian Minister of Defence Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio announced that the Brazilian Army would send 60 troops to Pacaraima to reinforce security at the border crossing with Venezuela, seeking to impede a potential Venezuelan crossing into Guyana from Brazilian territory.",
        "On 1 December, the International Court of Justice ordered Venezuela to refrain from taking action to change the status quo in the border dispute with Guyana. \"The court observes that the situation that currently prevails in the territory in dispute is that Guyana administers and exercises control over that area,\" presiding judge Joan Donoghue said. \"Venezuela must refrain from taking any action which would modify that situation,\" she added. On 4 December, Brazilian defence portal Defesa Net published an article detailing that an anonymous source from a Guyanaese officer claimed roughly 200 Venezuelan special forces had entered Guyanese territory disguised as civilians in order to conduct sabotage and other preparation operations.",
        "On 6 December, Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Yv\u00e1n Gil[es] and Guyana Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Hugh Todd had a phone call, at Guyana's request, and the countries agreed to \"keep communication channels open\", according to Venezuela's government.",
        "At the end of November 2023, the President of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, met with soldiers who guard the border between both countries. In a video released by the government Ali raised the Guyanese flag at an event on the Pakarampa mountain in the Essequibo, near Venezuela's Bol\u00edvar state, where he also took an oath of national loyalty. After these acts, the Minister of Defence of Venezuela, Vlad\u00edmir Padrino L\u00f3pez declared that the Venezuelan Armed Forces will be \"permanently vigilant\" of \"any action that threatens\" the \"territorial integrity\", asking the population to vote in the referendum and adding that the conflict \"for now\" is not a war. The governor of Zulia, Manuel Rosales, claimed that \"Guayana Esequiba is one hundred percent Venezuelan territory,\" arguing that Guyana's actions violated the 1966 Geneva agreement, and criticised the fact that the UN and the OAS did not speak out on the matter.",
        "Afterwards, Venezuelan government officials released a video where local indigenous people exchanged a Guyanese flag for a Venezuelan one. President Irfaan Ali assured that such replacement did not take place. In December, through geolocation, the investigative journalism group Bellingcat determined that the video was recorded near Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n, in the Venezulean state of Bol\u00edvar and 185 kilometers from where Guyana raised its flag, and not in the Guyana Esequiba as originally claimed. The Venezuelan fact-checking group Cazadores de Fake News reached the same conclusion in its own investigation, confirming with four sources in the area that the video was not recorded in the Guyana Esequiba.",
        "On 3 December, the Venezuelan government organised a referendum asking to support its position in the dispute. The National Electoral Council initially reported that Venezuelans voted \"yes\" more than 95% of the time on each of the five questions on the ballot. International analysts and media reported that turnout had been remarkably low and that the Venezuelan government had falsified the results. Analysts also noted that the government could use the referendum to mobilise its popular support and neutralise the opposition primaries success, as well as the growing popularity of its candidate Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. Bharrat Jagdeo, vice president of Guyana, said in an interview that he was preparing for the worst and that the government is working with partners to strengthen \"defence cooperation\". In anticipation of the referendum, the Commonwealth of Nations had also issued a statement offering its \"full support\" to Guyana and urged \"all members of the United Nations\" to respect the ICJ's decision. On 8 December, Maduro stated in a political rally that he had appointed several personnel to handle the incorporation of the Esequibo and signed several decrees, but he stated that this process would be completed in a timeframe \"up until 2030\".",
        "On 5 December, the Brazilian Army mobilised 20 Iveco LMV vehicles to join the newly activated 18th Mechanised Cavalry Regiment based in Boa Vista, being expected to arrive in early January. The regiment, originally planned to be activated in 2026, was created from the preexisting 12th Mechanised Cavalry Squadron on 29 November. An additional 600 soldiers will be added to the newly created 18th Cavalry Regiment, and an armored task force composed of 28 armored vehicles was assembled. Brazilian defence minister Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio said the presidency had ordered him to \"bulletproof the border\". The Brazilian military was also concerned that the situation would lead to the creation of additional American military bases in the region. Sources within the military also told reporters that they were detecting no suspicious movement along the Brazilian border, with the precaution of deterrence working there, but they believed Venezuela was more likely to invade from the sea. Brazil is expected to triple its military presence in the border, with much materiel being moved thousands of kilometers from its South and Center-West regions.",
        "On 8 December, Brazilian President Lula warned Maduro against \"unilateral measures\" by Venezuela regarding Essequibo. On December 11, M\u00facio characterised the crisis as a \"political maneuver\", and stated Brazil would not allow Venezuela troops to use its territory \"in any hypothesis\".",
        "On 18 December it was announced that the Brazilian Army had sent hundreds of MSS-1.2 anti-tank missiles to reinforce the border with Venezuela, sending the weapons would be a way of deterring a possible threat from the Venezuelan armored force.",
        "On 4 December, National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela Strategic Commander Domingo Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00e1rez made several posts on social media of Venezuelan military working on repairing or building new roads, bridges, airstrips and other infrastructure in the border with the Esequibo region, which he described as \"our Guyanese routes\". On 5 December, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced that he would soon permit the exploitation of resources such as gas, oil, and mineral deposits within the Essequibo. He also announced local Essequibo subsidiaries of Venezuelan state owned companies PDVSA and CVG. On the same day, Brazilian President Lula stated he'd make a presidential visit to Guyana next year, which analysts interpreted as signalling that Brazil would not tolerate Venezuelan military action. On 6 December, Lula announced a summit with special envoy Celso Amorim and foreign minister Mauro Vieira. The Brazilian Army reported to CNN Brasil that it had detected an increased Venezuelan military presence along the border with Guyana, though it assessed that the buildup by itself still wasn't indicative of an imminent invasion.",
        "The Guyanese president told Brazilian media that President Lula assured him Brazil would support Guyana, and thanked him for Brazil's \"mature\" position, while characterising Venezuela as \"reckless\" and \"unpredictable\". He claimed they were working with the United States Southern Command and expected \"strong statements\" to be made within the next 24 hours. The United States also announced military exercises with Guyanese forces.",
        "The same day, the Venezuelan government issued fourteen arrest warrants against opposition members, including for three members from the team of opposition political candidate Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, accusing them participating in an alleged plan to sabotage the 3 December referendum, supposedly financed by Exxon Mobil. It also confirmed the detention of an American citizen, Savoi Janson Wright, accused of financing them. That night, president of the Venezuelan NGO S\u00famate, Roberto Abdul, who also helped with the organisation of the opposition presidential primaries, was detained by officials of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service.",
        "The Venezuelan government also issued orders against opposition leaders and dissident Chavistas, including Yon Goicoechea, Juan Guaid\u00f3, Julio Borges, Andr\u00e9s Izarra, David Smolansky, Lester Toledo, Carlos Vecchio, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and Rafael Ram\u00edrez, accusing them of participating in a conspiracy to boycott and sabotage the referendum.",
        "On 6 December, a Guyana Defence Force (GDF) Bell 412 helicopter crashed en route from Georgetown-Camp Ayanganna to Arau, situated directly along the Venezuelan border in Essequibo, coming down about 30 miles (48km) east of Arau. It carried three crewmen and four passengers, and was piloted by GDF Lieutenant Colonel Michael Charles. According to the Chief of Staff of the Guyanese military, Omar Khan, there were no indications the aircraft was shot down from the sky. Authorities had stated that there was \"bad weather\" in the area. Five GDF soldiers were killed:",
        "Lieutenant Colonel Andio Michaeal Crawford and Corporal Dwayne Jackson survived.",
        "The United States Southern Command said on 7 December that its forces would participate in joint operations beside the Guyana Defence Force (GDF) in an effort to improve collaboration with security measures. US statements also said that the United States \"will continue its collaboration with the GDF in the areas of disaster preparedness, aerial and maritime security, and countering transnational criminal organizations\" and that the North American nation \"will continue its commitment as Guyana\u2019s trusted security partner and promoting regional cooperation and interoperability.\"",
        "Vladimir Padrino Lopez, Venezuelan defence minister, described the actions of the United States as a \"provocation\", saying that Venezuela \"will not be diverted from our future actions for the recovery of the Essequibo.\"",
        "Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ralph Gonsalves issued letters on 9 December to presidents Ali and Maduro, saying his nation would host discussions on the conflict alongside President Lula and UN Secretary-General Guterres, writing \"Let us all resolve to make this historic gathering a successful one. So much is at stake for our Caribbean and Latin American civilization.\" It was announced that the discussions would be mediated by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). Ali and Maduro agreed to the talks, with a proposed date of 14 December being announced. Following a phone call with Lula, President Maduro stated that he was looking for \"peace and understanding\". Representatives from both nations reaffirmed their beliefs on the dispute; Venezuela continued its claims of sovereignty over the Esequiba region while Guyana said that a determination by the ICJ must be made.",
        "On 14 December, high representatives (including the presidents) of Venezuela and Guyana met in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and agreed to not use any force and to not escalate tensions over Esequiba. A joint statement said both coutries will settle the dispute in accordance with international law, despite adding Venezuela does not recognise the ICJ jurisdiction over the case. Officials from the CARICOM, Brazil, Colombia, the United Nations and the CELAC also attended the meeting. Further talks were scheduled to be held in Brazil within three months from the meeting.",
        "On 15 December, Brazilian Defence Minister Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio mentioned Brazil was prepared to \"take more energetic measures if necessary\" to guarantee Brazilian territorial integrity. O Estado de S. Paulo reported that the Boa Vista-based 1st Jungle Infantry Brigade had received dozens of units of the Brazilian-made MSS-1.2 anti-tank guided missile. The early adoption of the ATGM, still in its evaluation stages, would seek to provide a solution to a lack of dedicated anti-tank capabilities in the Brazilian Army at the time of the border crisis.",
        "On 17 December, United Kingdom's minister for the Americas and Caribbean David Rutley visited Guyana, and said \"I am in Guyana... to offer the UK's unequivocal backing to our Guyanese friends\". Rutley also met with ambassadors of the United States, France, Canada and the European Union to speak about international support for Guyana in the dispute.",
        "The UK announced on 24 December it was sending one warship (HMS Trent) to the coast of Guyana without mentioning Venezuela. Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said on social media that Venezuela would stay \"on alert following provocations that put at risk the peace and stability of the Caribbean and our America.\"",
        "On 28 December, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro ordered over 5,600 Venezuelan military personnel to carry out \"defensive\" military exercises in response to the deployment of HMS Trent to Guyana.",
        "In response to perceived Venezuelan military buildups, Brazil reinforced its garrison in Boa Vista by 600 personnel and 20 armored vehicles on February 2, 2024. On February 9, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported on construction works and a troop buildup taking place in a Venezuelan military base in the border between Venezuela and Guyana in Ankoko Island. Videos from Venezuelan military social media accounts and Maxar satellite imagery of the area in the weeks leading up to the January 25 meeting in Bras\u00edlia showed the construction of a new jungle tank base taking place, as well as the presence of several assets such as IAI Arava and Mi-17 aircraft; EE-11 Urutu, Scorpion 90 and Cadillac Gage Commando AFVs; and a Mabey Compact 200 bridge. The CSIS's Christopher Hernandez-Roy referred to the Venezuelan troop buildup as indicative of Maduro \"pursuing a duplicitous policy\". Venezuelan General Domingo Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00e1rez, commander of the Strategic Operational Campaign of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces, referred to the satellite imagery in the CSIS's report as being \"North American imperial espionage [...] in service of its sepoys\".",
        "Analysts noted the decision of the Maduro administration to call a referendum may be an attempt to divert attention from Venezuelan internal problems such as the weak economy and high levels of government corruption. Political analysts also see the referendum as a nationalist strategy by the Maduro government to rally support ahead of the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election.",
        "Venezuela's actions towards annexing the Essequibo have been compared to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the preceding events of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the 2014 Crimean status referendum. James G. Stavridis, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, stated that Venezuela's actions, including its referendum, were \"an echo of Putin's invasion of Ukraine two years ago: a much larger neighbor staking a territorial claim without legitimate international legal grounds, preparing for annexation, making new maps and licking its chops at gaining huge natural resources.\" Igor Macedo de Lucena of Chatham House said \"Putin openly gave passports to anyone who entered a Russian administration in Crimea and [the citizens] left their Russian. Maduro can say that there [in Essequibo] is a large population of Neo-Venezuelans and he goes there to defend them from an attack by the Guyana government, all kinds of ideas to misrepresent public opinion and make an attack 'legitimate', when in fact there is no such threat. It's the whole plot of an invasion.\" Analysts have said that a new conflict occurring within the Americas would benefit Russia as it would likely distract the United States. Russia's involvement is not limited to selling military hardware to Maduro, as there are two reported Russian military bases within Venezuelan territory, as well a detachment of the Wagner Group private military company, which is involved in training Venezuelan elite troops as well as providing personal security for Maduro.",
        "Brazilian analyst Thiago de Arag\u00e3o said Venezuela has far greater military capabilities than Guyana, which enrols about 3,000 troops in light combat vehicles. Venezuela reportedly has 123,000 land troops distributed into several regiments as well as 173 main battle tanks, such as AMX-30 and T-72B1, along with reconnaissance vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers, as well as over 3 million paramilitary militia. It also has significant air and naval assets, compared to only a token air force on Guyana's side. However, any aggression against Guyana could trigger an intervention by regional powers such as Brazil or the United States.",
        "Visiting King's College London professor Augusto Teixeira said the Essequibo region mostly comprises mountains and dense tropical forest, with little to no roads. He suggests that the only feasible option for Venezuela would be moving its troops through Brazilian soil, in the state of Roraima. Military movements through Roraima would be significantly less hampered by the regional geography, as the Raposa Serra do Sol region is composed mostly of cerrado terrain, and the remaining wooded areas have been largely deforested. However, Brazil would not allow Venezuela to make any incursions from its territory. Venezuelan military is concentrated around Caracas and the northern border with Guyana along the Caribbean coast. Similarly, despite the Esequibo territory comprising around 70% of Guyanese territory, it is inhabited by only 125,000 out of Guyana's already much smaller 790,000 population."
